Magnetic separation is a method for the selective separation and concentration \textbf{Markus: das mit dem concentration fällt mir hier zum ersten mal auf, hast du das sonst auch erwähnt} of magnetic materials based on the differences in magnetic properties between particles. Despite continued progress, a multidimensional \textbf{Markus: was bedeutet das?} separation of magnetic nanoparticles still constitutes a major challenge. In this work, a new \textbf{Markus:novel statt new (?)} approach for the separation of magnetic nanoparticles with a multicolumn chromatography system is investigated. In order to identify the influence of different parameters on the separation process, an in silico model simulating the interactions between a simplified packed bed and a suspension of magnetic nanoparticles was developed and validated. With this model parameter studies were conducted for different conditions. It is shown that higher magnetic field strenghts lead to a size dependent retention of the nanoparticles in the vicinity of the matrix material. It can also be \textbf{Markus:is statt can also be} demonstrated, that a decrease in the size of the matrix material elements results in an increase of the retention and size separation effect. The flow rate on contrary does not have a significant impact on the residence time in the tested regime.  

In addition, the different retention of nanoparticles depending on the their size and magnetic properties within a magnetized packed bed is investigated experimentally in a one \textbf{Markus:one or single} column setup. It is demonstrated, that the observed retention of the nanoparticles is solely caused by the magnetized packed bed and is not produced \textbf{Markus:vllt eher: due to the column ...}  by the column packing or setup. The performance of the system was evaluated for several different \textbf{Markus:differently (?)}  sized nanoparticle suspensions and different concentrations. Furthermore, a limited ability to separate two nanoparticle suspensions of different sizes with the separation column is demonstrated. This indicates that a complete size separation of the nanoparticle suspensions should be possible with the multicolumn chromatography system.
