In the course of this thesis a two-dimensional numerical model of the retention of nanoparticles within magnetized packed beds was developed using the commercially available COMSOL multiphysics software. The main goal of the simulation was to identify the influences of different parameters like the particle size, flow velocity or magnetic field strength on the retention behaviour of the magnetic nanoparticles. 
A single wire model was developed based on a model provided by A. Ebner \cite{choomphon2017simulation}. The numerical model was validated for the magnetic field and the fluid flow characteristics using analytical and experimental data as well as results from other simulations (see Section \ref{subsec:mod_val}). In addition the computation time and accuracy of the finite element based model were optimized by a mesh refinement study. For the single wire model constant velocity and periodic boundary conditions were tested on the channel walls. Parameter studies investigating the influence of the magnetic flux density, wire radius, inlet flow velocity and particle size on the residence time of magnetic nanoparticles were conducted in Section\,\ref{subsec:Param_res}. It could be shown that an increase in the magnetic flux density leads to an increased retention of the nanoparticles in the vicinity of the ferromagnetic wire. An increase in the wire radius results in a decrease of the magnetization of the wire at the same flux density and therefore lower residence times. Consequently matrix material with a radius of 30\,nm or smaller should be applied for practical use. Higher flow velocities lead to higher a higher retention as the particles are brought closer to the wire by the fluid flow as compared to slower flow velocities. The magnetic force affecting the nanoparticles increases with increasing particle size, which also leads to a stronger retention of the nanoparticles. This indicates a size separation effect for different sized nanoparticles by their different retention time in magnetized packed beds.

As the study of a single wire does not reflect the real conditions in a separation column, two and four wire models were developed (see Section \ref{subsubsec:Two_wires}). Again parameter studies were run to investigate the influence of the magnetic flux density, particle size and inlet flow velocity. It could be shown that the inlet flow velocity did not have a great effect on the particle residence time, as the fluid velocity was highly increased in the cross section between the wires independently from the inlet velocity. An increasing size separation effect could be demonstrated for increasing magnetic flux densities. However the model proved to be unstable and did not converge for magnetic flux densities above 35\,mT, where to many particles were retained. The instabilities occurred once the magnetic force affecting the particles became too strong, e.g. for larger nanoparticles over 50\,nm at magnetic flux densities higher than 15\,mT. Therefore, a more stable model design would be desirable, in order to further investigate the influencing parameters. In a next step the single wire model should be extended to three dimensions. Eventually the whole packed bed should be simulated to reflect the real situation within a separation column and to reliably predict the retention behaviour of the nanoparticles. This could be achieved by implementing the model in the open-source program OpenLB based on the Lattice Boltzmann method. This would allow a high degree of parallelization, which is necessary for the computation of such a complex model.     

In the second part of this study retention experiments with a separation column were conducted. The objective was to investigate the influence of the magnetic field strength and particle size on the retention behaviour of magnetic nanoparticles in a real packed bed. Furthermore the size separation effect within the column observed by \cite{AndreMaster} should be reproduced with a different matrix material. 
In a first step several matrix materials and nanoparticle suspensions were characterized. The matrix materials PMMA and TruForm were chosen due to their diamagnetic and ferromagnetic properties, respectively, as well as for their size and shape. Almost spherical matrix particles with an average size of 30\,nm or under were desired. The nanoparticle supensions were examined for their particle size distribution and their superparamagnetic behaviour. The Chemagen and Micromod nanoparticle solutions were selected for the experiments, where the Chemagen solution exhibited a much wider particle size distribution than the Micromod particles. In order to optimize the peak shape a flow rate of 0.5\,ml/min was selected. The external magnetic field  was produced by a Helmholtz coil through a square wave signal. This allowed the investigation of the influence of different magnetic field strengths, settings and frequencies. The PMMA matrix material was selected due to its non-magnetic behaviour as a negative controle. It could be shown that even for magnetic flux densities as high as 12\,mT no significant retention or peak broadening effect occur. This demonstrates that the retention observed with the ferromagnetic matrix material is solely due to the magnetized packed bed and not produced by the column packing or setup. Furthermore no size exclusion effect on the nanoparticle suspension through the packed bed could be observed. In contrast increasing retention and peak broadening could be observed with the ferromagnetic TruForm matrix material for increasing magnetic flux densities. For magnetic field densities larger than 10\,mT a decrease of the peak area was apparent in addition to the retention. For high magnetic field strengths the larger particles are collected by within the matrix and do not elute. Due to the remanence of the matrix material the particles could only be retrieved after the demagnetization of the packed bed. A maximum retention of 24\,\% was reached with a  constant magnetic field with a magnetic flux density of 17\,mT for a 1:150 dilution of the Chemagen nanoparticle suspension. 

The size separation effect observed by \cite{AndreMaster} could also be reproduced for the TruForm matrix material with the Chemagen nanoparticles. To evaluate the effect, the resulting peaks were fractionated after the column. The fractions were then analyzed for their particle size distributions. The resulting distributions were compared to the size distribution at 0\,mT and the original feed suspension. In order to quantify the size separation effect more closely Micromod nanoparticles with an average size of 100 and 20\,nm were used. For the 100\,nm particles an increase in the D90 value of 34\,\% from the first to the third fraction could be observed. For the 20\,nm however the trend was less pronounced. As a last step the size separation of a 1:1 mixture of the two Micromod nanoparticle suspensions was attempted. Due to the the wide particle size distribution of the 20\,nm particles no clear separation could be measured, even though the usual size separation effect was observed. The resulting chromatogram, however, showed two peaks which became more distinct with an increasing magnetic flux density. This suggests that a complete separation of the components should be possible with either higher magnetic field strengths or a longer separation column. Instead of a longer column a \gls{smb} could be applied to separate the two peaks. \Gls{smb} is a continuous countercurrent chromatography method, which was developed in the late 1950s by engineers from Universal Oil Products\cite{broughton1961continuous,carson1962rotary}. With this method a continuous binary separation of a mixture can be achieved with high purity and yield. As for the \gls{smb} process at least four columns are necessary, this would also allow the possibilities of applying different magnetic field strengths on the different columns to refine the separation process  This could eventually lead to a continuous size fractionation process for magnetic nanoparticles at an industrial scale.
