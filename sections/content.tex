\section{Fundamentals of magnetism}
\label{sec:Fund_mag}
The focus of this thesis was to establish a size separation process for nanoparticles by using magnetic separation technologies. The concept of magnetic separation is based on the properties of magnetic fields and magnetic materials. Therefore the following sections give an overview of the fundamental equations and material properties related to magnetism. Magnetism is a physical phenomenon produced by the motion of electric charges, which results in attractive and repulsive forces between objects \cite{stevenson2010oxford}. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles are the origin of magnetic fields, which generate these forces. Sections \ref{subsec:Maxwell}, \ref{subsec:const_rel} and \ref{subsec:Mag_pot} give an overview of the basic electromagnetic equations describing those fields, while in Section\,\ref{subsec:Mag_mat} the magnetic properties of materials are discussed.

\subsection{Maxwell's equations}
\label{subsec:Maxwell}
%%%%%%%%%Quellen einfügen%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \cite{kallenbach2018elektromagnete}
The correlation between magnetic and electric fields, as well as the relation of those fields to electrical charges and currents, are described by  Maxwell’s equations. In combination with the Lorentz force law these equations describe all classical electromagnetic phenomena \cite{meschede2015gerthsen}. The macroscopic Maxwell equations (see Equations\,\ref{eq:Faraday}, \ref{eq:Ampere}, \ref{eq:Gauss_elec} and \ref{eq:Gauss_mag}) for general time-varying fields in the differential form are as follows \cite{monk2003finite}: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Faraday}
\centering
\nabla\times\boldsymbol{E} = -\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{B}}{\partial t}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Ampere}
\centering
\nabla\times\boldsymbol{H} = \boldsymbol{J} + \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{D}}{\partial t}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Gauss_elec}
\centering
\nabla\cdotp\boldsymbol{D} = \rho 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Gauss_mag}
\centering
\nabla\cdotp\boldsymbol{B} = 0
\end{equation}

where the used fundamental electromagnetic quantities are the electric field intensity $\boldsymbol{E}$ in V/m, the magnetic flux density $\boldsymbol{B}$ in T, the magnetic field intensity $\boldsymbol{H}$ in A/m, the electric current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ in A/m\textsuperscript{2}, the electric flux density $\boldsymbol{D}$ in C/m\textsuperscript{2} and the electric charge density $\rho$ in C/m\textsuperscript{3} \cite{meschede2015gerthsen,monk2003finite}. $\nabla\times$ stands for the curl operator which is a measure of the rotation of a vector field, while $\nabla\cdotp$ denotes the divergence of a field. Equation\,\ref{eq:Faraday}, also known as Faraday's law of induction, describes how a time varying magnetic field induces a spatially varying electric field, while Equation\,\ref{eq:Ampere}, which is referred to as Ampere's law, states that magnetic fields are generated by either electric currents or time varying electric fields. Together they describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Equation\,\ref{eq:Gauss_elec} and \ref{eq:Gauss_mag} are called Gauss's law and Gauss's law of magnetism respectively. Equation\,\ref{eq:Gauss_elec} gives the effect of the charge density on the electric field. It states that the electric flux through any hypothetical closed surface is proportional to the net electric charge enclosed by this surface, which becomes obvious in its integral form. Gauss's law of magnetism states that, contrary to electric charges, magnetic monopoles do not exist and that $\boldsymbol{B}$ is always a solenoidal vector field. Instead, a magnetic field is induced by magnetic dipoles. Because of the relationship of $\boldsymbol{B}$ and $\boldsymbol{H}$ (see Equation\,\ref{eq:B_vac}) the divergence of the magnetic field intensity is also zero \cite{monk2003finite,kallenbach2018elektromagnete}.
The combination of Gauss' and Ampere's law results in the continuity equation (see Equation\,\ref{eq:Konti_Mag}) which specifies the conservation of charge. It states that the net quantity of charges is always conserved \cite{monk2003finite,meschede2015gerthsen,schwab2013begriffswelt}.   

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Konti_Mag}
\centering
\nabla\cdotp\boldsymbol{J} = -\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}
\end{equation}

For static fields, i.e. no variation of the field quantities with time, the Equations \ref{eq:Faraday}, \ref{eq:Ampere} and \ref{eq:Konti_Mag} are reduced to:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Faraday_stat}
\centering
\nabla\times\boldsymbol{E} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Ampere_stat}
\centering
\nabla\times\boldsymbol{H} = \boldsymbol{J} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Konti_Mag_stat}
\centering
\nabla\cdotp\boldsymbol{J} = 0
\end{equation}

\subsection{Constitutive relations}
\label{subsec:const_rel}

In order to apply Maxwell's macroscopic equations they must be augmented with two constitutive relations. The constitutive relations describe the relationship between $\boldsymbol{D}$ and $\boldsymbol{E}$ as well as between $\boldsymbol{B}$ and $\boldsymbol{H}$ depending on the macroscopic properties of the medium. The constitutive relations in empty space can be written as Equations\,\ref{eq:disp_const_rel} and \ref{eq:B_vac}. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:disp_const_rel}
\centering
\boldsymbol{D} = \varepsilon_{0}\boldsymbol{E} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:B_vac}
\centering
\boldsymbol{B} = \mu_{0}\boldsymbol{H}
\end{equation}

with the vacuum permittivity $\varepsilon_{0}$ which takes a value of 8.854$\cdotp$10\textsuperscript{-12}\,F/m and the vacuum permeability $\mu_{0}$ with a value of 4$\pi\cdotp$10\textsuperscript{-7} H/m \cite{monk2003finite,kallenbach2018elektromagnete}. For linear materials, which are characterized by a linear relation between the magnetization and the magnetic field intensity as shown in Equation\,ref{eq:chi}, the relationship between $\boldsymbol{B}$ and $\boldsymbol{H}$ is described by Equation\,\ref{eq:B_tot}. A similar relationship can be formulated for the electric field (see Equation\,\ref{eq:D_tot}).    

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:B_tot}
\centering
\boldsymbol{B} = \mu_{0}\mu_{r}\boldsymbol{H}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:D_tot}
\centering
\boldsymbol{D} = \varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon_{r}\boldsymbol{E}
\end{equation}

Here $\mu_{r}$ indicates the relative permeability of the medium, while $\varepsilon_{r}$ stands for the relative permittivity of the material. $\mu_{r}$ is a measure of the permeability $\mu$ of a material relative to that of vacuum (see Equation\,\ref{eq:mu_r}).
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mu_r}
\centering
\mu_{r} = \frac{\mu}{\mu_{0}}
\end{equation}

 Materials with $\mu_{r}$ larger than one are called paramagnetic, while materials with a value of $\mu_{r}$ less than one are referred to as diamagnetic \cite{svoboda2004magnetic}. In contrast, ferromagnetic materials exhibit a hysteresis function. For a more detailed description of the material properties see Section\,\ref{subsec:Mag_mat}. The magnetic flux density is also influenced by the magnetization $\boldsymbol{M}$ of the material as shown below \cite{ichimura1989maxwell}: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Mag}
\centering
\boldsymbol{B} = \mu_{0}(\boldsymbol{H} + \boldsymbol{M})
\end{equation}

For linear materials there is a directly proportional relationship between the magnetization and the magnetic field intensity with the specific/mass magnetic susceptibility $\chi$.  

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:chi}
\centering
\boldsymbol{M} = \chi\boldsymbol{H}
\end{equation}

Materials with positive values of $\chi$ are paramagnetic, whereas materials with negative values of $\chi$ are called diamagnetic. For ferromagnetic materials $\chi$ is dependent on the previous magnetization of the medium as well as the particle size and shape \cite{michalowsky2006magnettechnik}. The magnetic susceptibility is also related to the relative permeability (see Equation\,\ref{eq:chi_2}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:chi_2}
\centering
\chi = \mu_{r}-1
\end{equation}

For some materials a non-linear relationship between $\boldsymbol{B}$ and $\boldsymbol{H}$ can be found as shown in Equation\,\ref{eq:nonlin_B}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nonlin_B}
\centering
\boldsymbol{B} = f(\vert\boldsymbol{H}\vert)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Magnetic vector potential}
\label{subsec:Mag_pot}
A solenoidal vector field can always be written as the curl of a different vector field. Consequently $\boldsymbol{B}$ can also be formulated as the curl of the magnetic vector potential $\boldsymbol{A}$. The magnetic vector potential $\boldsymbol{A}$ results from Gauss' law of magnetism (see Equation\,\ref{eq:Gauss_mag}). For magnetostatics $\boldsymbol{A}$ in Vs/m is related to $\boldsymbol{B}$ by the following Equation\,\ref{eq:Pot_A}.  

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Pot_A}
\centering
\boldsymbol{B} = \nabla\times\boldsymbol{A}
\end{equation}

As a vector field can only be fully specified by its divergence and its curl $\nabla\cdotp\boldsymbol{A}$ has to be defined. By choosing $\nabla\cdotp\boldsymbol{A}$ the magnetic vector potential is defined completely. In magnetostatics the gauge condition $\nabla\cdotp\boldsymbol{A}$ = 0 is applied \cite{schwab2013begriffswelt}.   

\subsection{Magnetic properties of materials}
\label{subsec:Mag_mat}

%Figure of permeability curves
%saturation is most clearly seen in the magnetization curve (also called BH curve %or hysteresis curve) of a substance, as a bending to the right of the curve (see %graph at right). As the H field increases, the B field approaches a maximum value %asymptotically, the saturation level for the substance.

For the separation of magnetic materials the differences in their magnetic behaviour is crucial, therefore a short overview of the different types of magnetic properties is given below. The origin of magnetism lies in the orbital and spin motions of electrons, therefore all materials are magnetic and show a magnetic response. The magnetic moments of the nuclei of the atoms are negligible. Usually,  the magnetic moments of the electrons within a material cancel each other out. When a material is placed in a magnetic field however the magnetic moments align. This effect is called magnetization. The main difference between different types of materials is the different alignment of the magnetic moments. According to their magnetic properties, materials can be divided into three main classes: diamagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic. In addition antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials can be defined. The different groups are listed in Table\,\ref{table:mag_material} distinguished by their material specific values of the relative permeability and the magnetic susceptibility. 

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Classification of magnetic materials}
\label{table:mag_material}
\begin{tabular}{lll}\hline
class & relative permeability & magnetic susceptibility \\
\hline\hline
diamagnetic & $\mu_{r}<1$ & $\chi<0$ \\
paramagnetic & $\mu_{r}>1$ & $\chi>0$ \\
ferromagnetic & $\mu_{r}\gg1$ &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Diamagnetism occurs in all matter, for para- and ferromagentic materials however this effect is negligible and will be masked by the other magnetic properties of the medium, consequently only materials with no other overlaying magnetic properties are allotted to the diamagnetic class. In the presence of a magnetic field the orbital magnetic moments aligned in the opposite direction of the external field are increased, while the moments aligned parallel to the external field are decreased. Therefore diamagnetic materials are repelled by a magnetic field. This effect however is very weak. Typical diamagnetic materials have no unpaired electrons in the shell such as water, silica and most organic compounds \cite{svoboda2004magnetic,griffiths2011elektrodynamik}.

In paramagnetic materials one or more unpaired electrons are present. In contrast to paired electrons which always have their spin oriented in opposite directions, unpaired electrons carry dipole moments which can align in any direction. Without an external magnetic field the moments point in random directions due to thermal motion leading to a net magnetization of zero. When a magnetic field is applied, the moments align themselves in the direction of the field, thus a positive magnetization is generated reinforcing the applied field. As this aligning effect competes with the randomizing forces of the thermal vibration the overall magnetization that can be achieved in a paramagnetic material is small compared to the magnetization achieved in ferromagentic matter. The directed magnetization is not retained once the magnetic field is removed. Paramagnetic elements are by example aluminium, magnesium and oxygen \cite{svoboda2004magnetic,griffiths2011elektrodynamik}.

%%%%%%%superparamegnets    
Ferromagnetism is based on the same basic effect as paramagnetism, where magnetic moments of unpaired electrons align themselves in the presence of an external magnetic field. In ferromagnetic materials however the interaction of the adjoining atoms is much stronger than the thermal motion, which leads to an uniform alignment in micrometer-scale regions. These regions are called Weiss domains and can arise spontaneously, even without an external magnetic field. In the presence of a magnetic field the Weiss domains align in the direction of the field until a saturation magnetization $M_{s}$ is reached. With increasing temperatures the influence of the thermal motion also increases. At a certain temperature, referred to as Curie Temperature, the system can no longer maintain the magnetization. Above the Curie temperature the behaviour of ferromagnetic materials is similar to that of paramagnetic materials. Only few substances exhibit ferromagnetic behaviour, these include iron, nickel and cobalt as well as most of their alloys. Some rare earth metals like gadolinium and terbium are also ferrromagnetic \cite{svoboda2004magnetic}. The state of magnetization of ferromagnetic materials does not solely depend on the applied magnetic field, but also on the magnetic history, shape and size of the sample. The material retains a magnetization, called remanence magnetization $M_{r}$, even after the removal of the external field. The magnetization behaviour of ferromagnetic materials can be characterized by a hysteresis loop. The magnetization behaviour of dia- and paramagnetic materials can be described by a straight line in a M vs. H diagram. The y-intercept is at the origin of the coordinate system, which indicates that no remanence occurs. A typical hysteresis loop of a ferromagnetic material is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:hyst_loop}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering

\scalebox{0.60}{\includegraphics{figures/hysteresis_sample.pdf}}
\caption[Hysteresis loop of a ferromagnetic material]{Example of a hysteresis loop of a ferromagnetic material: $M_{r}$ is the remanent magnetization at H=0; ${H}_{c}$ is the coercivity, i.e. the reverse field that reduces $M$ to zero; $M_{s}$ is the saturation magnetization
\label{fig:hyst_loop}
}
\end{figure}

The upward curve starting at the origin is the inital magnetization curve which increases rapidly for increasing values of H until the saturation magnetization $M_{s}$ is reached. When H is now reduced, the magnetization decreases on a different curve. For a magnetic field intensity of zero the remanence magnetization $M_{r}$ is reached. In order to demagnetize the material a magnetic field, with a field intensity of $H_{c}$, also called the coercivity, must be applied in the opposite direction\cite{svoboda2004magnetic,sung2003physics,aharoni2000introduction}. 

Ferrimagnetic materials exhibit similar properties as ferromagentic materials as they both reach saturation and show much higher magnetization than either dia- or paramagnetic materials. As in ferromagnetic materials the magnetic moments are ordered regularly, but for ferrimagnetic materials in an antiparallel sense. However the opposing moments are unequal and a spontaneous magnetization still occurs. Ferrimagnetic behaviour is mainly shown by ferrites and mixed oxides of iron for example magnetite \cite{svoboda2004magnetic,michalowsky2006magnettechnik}.

Ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials can also be divided by the value of their coercivity. Materials with a $H_{c}$ below 1\,kA/m are called magnetically soft, while materials with a larger value of $H_{c}$ are referred to as magnetically hard. Magnetically soft materials are easily magnetized and demagnetized, but exhibit only low remanent fields, in contrast magnetically hard materials will remain magnetized indefinitely unless they are demagnetized by an opposing magnetic field or heated above the Curie temperature \cite{meschede2015gerthsen}\cite{michalowsky2006magnettechnik}. 

\subsection{Influence of the particle shape and size}
\label{subsec:part_shape}
As already mentioned in Section\,\ref{subsec:Mag_mat}, the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials do not solely depend on the applied magnetic field, but also on the shape and size of the sample \cite{gomez2009influence}. The specific magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ is equivalent to $\kappa/\rho$, where $\kappa$ is the volume magnetic susceptibility and $\rho$ the material density. Therefore Equation\,\ref{eq:chi} can also be written as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kappa}
\centering
\boldsymbol{M} = \kappa\boldsymbol{H_{0}}
\end{equation}

where an external, homogeneous magnetic field with a magnetic field intensity of $H_{0}$ is applied. Here, $\kappa$ is not only dependent on the material, but also on the size and shape of the particle. The shape dependency can be explained by a demagnetizing field $H_{d}$ generated within the particle. The magnetic field $H_{i}$ inside the magnetized particle is not equal to the applied magnetic field $H_{0}$. The difference arises from the induction of a magnetic field $H_{d}$ inside of the finite ferromagnetic body of the particle opposing the external field. $H_{d}$ is proportional to $M$ as shown in Equation\,\ref{eq:demag_fac}. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:demag_fac}
\centering
\boldsymbol{H_{d}} = -N\boldsymbol{M}
\end{equation}

The dimensionless demagnetization factor $N$, with values in the range of 0 to 1, is dependent on the particle shape and the direction of magnetization. The inner magnetic field $H_{i}$ can therefore be calculated by Equation\,\ref{eq:int_field}. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:int_field}
\centering
\boldsymbol{H_{i}} = \boldsymbol{H_{0}} + \boldsymbol{H_{d}} = \boldsymbol{H_{0}} - N\boldsymbol{M}
\end{equation}

In case $N$ is known the magnetization of a material can be calculated solely from its material properties as shown in Equation\,\ref{eq:mag_demag_fac}. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mag_demag_fac}
\centering
\boldsymbol{M} = \frac{\kappa{i}}{1+N\kappa_{i}}\boldsymbol{H_{0}}
\end{equation}

Where $\kappa$ from Equation\,\ref{eq:kappa} is substituted by the fraction $\kappa_{i}/(1+N\kappa_{i})$ with the intrinsic susceptibility $\kappa_{i}$, which is the true susceptibility after the removal of the effects of $H_{d}$ \cite{FranzrebHabil,svoboda2004magnetic}.
 
The magnetic properties of ferromagentic materials are not only influenced by the shape, but also by the size of the particles. When the particle size is sufficiently small, the particle will consist of only a single magnetic domain (for further explanations of magnetic domains see Section\,\ref{subsec:Mag_mat}). Single domain nanoparticles have been experimentally observed, for example by Majetich and Jin \cite{majetich1999magnetization}. The maximum diameter for spherical single domain particles is called the critical size. The critical size lies e.g. at approximately 0.05\,\textmu m for magnetite \cite{svoboda2004magnetic,butler1975theoretical}. Single domain particles are considered to be magnetized to saturation in one or the opposite direction, even if no external field is applied. Due to thermal motion the magnetization will fluctuate randomly between the two directions. This behaviour is called superparamagnetism.
Superparamagnetism is based on the same mechanism as paramagnetism, except that the magnetic moments are replaced by the moments of entire particles. Measurements of the magnetization of a larger number of superparamagnetic particles result in an observed net magnetization of zero, as the magnetization of each particle is oriented randomly. When an external field is applied, the moments of the particles will align and the net magnetization increases until saturation is reached. Once the field is removed, however, the particle moments will lose coherence and no net magnetization is retained. Consequently superparamagnetic particles show a coercivity and remanence of zero similar to paramagnetic materials combined with a high saturation magnetization comparable to ferromagnetic matter \cite{svoboda2004magnetic,FranzrebHabil}.      
    
\section{Fundamentals of magnetic separation}
\label{sec:Mag_sep}
Since the 19\textsuperscript{th} century magnetic separation processes have been used to concentrate and separate minerals. More recently, applications in waste water treatment, food industry and biotechnology have become available \cite{yavuz2009magnetic}. Magnetic separation technologies are used for the concentration of magnetic materials  as well as the removal of magnetizable particles from process fluids. For separation, the magnetic particles within a suspension are influenced by a non-homogeneous magnetic field, which leads to either retention or deflection of the particles. The external magnetic field can be generated by a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. In addition, the particles are influenced by other external forces e.g. gravitational, inertial, hydrodynamic and centrifugal forces (see Section\,\ref{subsec:bas_princ}). Furthermore electrostatic and electromagnetic interparticle forces affect the separation. Consequently, the magnetic force $F_{mag}$ must be greater than the sum of the competing forces $F_{comp}$ for successful separation of the particles from the surrounding fluid. For a selective separation of particles with different magnetic susceptibilities, the magnetic force acting on the more magnetic particles must be larger than the sum of $F_{comp}$ and for less magnetic particles smaller than the sum of $F_{comp}$. This condition is described in Equation\,\ref{eq:mag_sep_cond}, where $F_{mag}^{m}$ and $F_{mag}^{l}$ are the magnetic forces affecting the more and less strongly magnetic materials respectively and $F_{comp}$ summarizes the competing forces on the different particles \cite{svoboda2004magnetic,oberteuffer1974magnetic}.   

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mag_sep_cond}
\centering
F_{mag}^{m}\geq\sum_{i}F_{comp}^{im} \quad \textrm{and} \quad F_{mag}^{l}\leq\sum_{i}F_{comp}^{il}
\end{equation}

In the following Section a more detailed explanation of the magnetic and the competing forces is given (see Section\,\ref{subsec:bas_princ}). In addition the basic concepts of \gls{hgms} and a simplified model approach are outlined in the Sections\,\ref{subsec:HGMS}, \ref{subsec:mag_field} and \ref{subsec:single_wire}.  

\subsection{Basic principles}
\label{subsec:bas_princ}
The concept of magnetic separation is based on the property of magnetic fields to exert a force on matter. The magnetic force $F_{m}$ on a particle is given by Equation\,\ref{eq:mag_force}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mag_force}
\centering
\boldsymbol{F}_{m} = \mu_{0}V_{p}\boldsymbol{M}_{p}\nabla\boldsymbol{H}
\end{equation}

where $V_{p}$ denotes the volume of the particle, $\boldsymbol{M}_{p}$ the particle magnetization and $\nabla\boldsymbol{H}$ the gradient of the applied magnetic field. For simplicity it is assumed that $F_{m}$ acts on the center of gravity of the particle. $\boldsymbol{M}_{p}$ can be calculated either by Equation\,\ref{eq:chi}, \ref{eq:kappa} or \ref{eq:mag_demag_fac}. As shown in Table\,\ref{table:mag_material}, the magnetic susceptibility for diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials is constant, while $\chi$ for ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic substances is dependent on the magnetic field strength, the size and the shape of the particles (see Sections \ref{subsec:Mag_mat} and \ref{subsec:part_shape}). For spherical particles $F_{m}$ is also directly proportional to the cube of its radius $b$. 

As already mentioned above (see Section\,\ref{sec:Mag_sep}), the motion of the particles is also influenced by several different  forces. For ferromagnetic particles larger than approximately 1\,\textmu m the relevant competing forces are  the hydrodynamic drag force $F_{d}$, to a lesser degree in liquids the gravitational force $F_{g}$ and depending on the separator type the centrifugal force $F_{c}$.  


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:grav_force}
\centering
\boldsymbol{F}_{g} = (\rho_{p}-\rho_{f})V_{p}\boldsymbol{g}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:drag_force}
\centering
\boldsymbol{F}_{d} = 6\pi\eta b(\boldsymbol{v}_{f}-\boldsymbol{v}_{p})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cent_force}
\centering
\boldsymbol{F}_{c} = (\boldsymbol{v}_{f}-\boldsymbol{v}_{p})\omega V_{p}\boldsymbol{r}
\end{equation}

$F_{g}$ for a spherical particle is given by Equation\,\ref{eq:grav_force}, where $g$ is the acceleration by gravity in m/s\textsuperscript{2} and $\rho_{p}$ and $\rho_{f}$ are the densities of the particle and the surrounding fluid in kg/m\textsuperscript{3}, respectively. The hydrodynamic drag force of a particle is determined by Stoke's law (see Equation\,\ref{eq:drag_force}), where $\eta$ denotes the dynamic viscosity of the fluid in Pa$\cdotp$s, $v_{f}$ the velocity of the fluid in m/s and $v_{p}$ the velocity of the particle in m/s. Stokes law is only valid for laminar flow around spherical objects with low Reynolds numbers and no interaction between the fluid and the particle. For our test cases low velocities and small particle sizes with no coupling between the particles were assumed and therefore Stokes law was applicable. $F_{c}$ is described by Equation\,\ref{eq:cent_force}, where $\omega$ is the angular velocity in rad/s and $r$ is the radial position of the particle. Equation\,\ref{eq:force_rad} shows the dependency of the different forces on the particle radius $b$ which could already be derived from Equation\,\ref{eq:grav_force} to \ref{eq:cent_force}. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:force_rad}
\centering
F_{g}\sim b^{3}, \quad F_{d}\sim b^{1} \quad \textrm{and} \quad F_{c}\sim b^{3}
\end{equation}

The equations show that $F_{g}$ and $F_{c}$ are directly proportional to the cube of the particle radius, consequently their contribution increases significantly with increasing particle size. $F_{d}$ however depends on the first power of the particle radius and will be relevant for smaller particles \cite{svoboda2004magnetic,oberteuffer1974magnetic}. For particles smaller than approximately 1\,\textmu m Brownian motion also needs to be considered. Brownian motion is the apparently random movement of particles in a fluid due to their collisions with other particles, atoms or molecules of the fluid \cite{brown1828xxvii}. The Langevin equation can be used for the description of Brownian motion (for more detailed information see \cite{Langevin,BrownianDynamics,BrownianModel}). It states that the minute fluctuations in the position of the particles are due to a random force. Einstein and Sutherland obtained a relation between the macroscopic diffusion constant $D$ and the atomic properties of matter \cite{einstein1906theorie,einstein1905molekularkinetischen,sutherland1905lxxv}. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Stokes_Einstein}
\centering
D = \frac{k_{B}T}{6\pi\eta b}
\end{equation}

Equation\,\ref{eq:Stokes_Einstein}, called Stokes-Einstein equation, describes the diffusion of spherical particles through a fluid with low Reynolds numbers. $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant with a value of 1.38064852$\cdotp$10\textsuperscript{-23}\,J/K, which can be calculated by the division of the universal gas constant $R$ by the Avogadro constant $N_{A}$, while $T$ is the temperature of the surrounding fluid. Particle diffusion can be pictured as a driving force which is based on the gradient in the particle concentration. 
A diffusion force $F_{B}$ acting on the particles can therefore be described by Equation\,\ref{eq:diff_force} as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff_force}
\centering
\boldsymbol{F}_{B} = -k_{B}T\frac{\nabla n}{n}
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the number density of particles within the fluid \cite{choomphon2017simulation,moeser2004high,fletcher1991fine}. 

As the type of particles, defined by their shape, size and material, is usually given, the main influencing factors on $F_{m}$ for the magnetic separation are the magnetic field strength and its gradient. Consequently the combination of magnetic field strength and field gradient must be optimized for each application individually. The most common magnetic separators can be divided into three basic categories: open gradient magnetic separators, closed-gradient magnetic separators and matrix (polygradient) magnetic separators \cite{svoboda2004magnetic}. \Gls{hgms}, which are used for the recovery of micron sized particles, belong to the class of matrix separators. In the following section the principles of \gls{hgms} will be further explained.  


\subsection{High gradient magnetic separation}
\label{subsec:HGMS}
In conventional magnetic separators only ferromagnetic materials with a particle size larger than approximately 50\,\textmu m can be separated. \Gls{hgms}, based on the Frantz Ferrofilter, enables the magnetic separation of smaller and only weakly magnetic particles \cite{frantz1937patent,ge2017magnetic}. This is achieved through the combination of strong magnetic fields and high magnetic field gradients. Ferromagnetic bodies, called the matrix, are placed in the external magnetic field. The applied magnetic field induces magnetic moments in the ferromagnetic matrix which leads to high magnetic field gradients in the proximity of the matrix elements \cite{shukla2006process}. Magnetically susceptible particles move along the gradient towards the magnetized matrix elements and are captured on the surface \cite{hoffmann2002novel}. As the magnitude of the magnetic field gradient as well as the collection surface are dependant on the shape, size, arrangement and placement of the used bodies, the matrix material e.g. balls, grooved plates, steel wool or rods has to be chosen carefully (more information on different matrix materials can be found in \cite{iacob2002high,kim2013effects,takayasu1981matrices}). The matrix has to be fine enough to generate a strong enough magnetic field gradient for selective separation, but also not so strong as to cause matrix blockage and retention of non-magnetic materials. As the filling factor of the used matrix material is often low, e.g. 0.04 and 0.20 for steel wool and expanded metal respectively and as the matrix does not conduct magnetic flux very well, strong external fields are required. An exception are matrices consisting of balls with a filling factor of up to 0.50 and grooved plates with a filling factor of 0.80. 
%In general, the separation efficiency of ball matrices is smaller than the in filament units, as a closed packed array of spheres does not leave much space for the collection of particles.

A schematic drawing of a \gls{hgms} is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:hgms}. The particle suspension flows through the matrix. Particles with high magnetic susceptibilities accumulate on the matrix surface while the rest of the suspension leaves the system. Once the matrix is saturated with particles, the external magnetic field is turned off and the collected particles are recovered \cite{svoboda2004magnetic,gerber1983high,ditsch2005high}. \gls{hgms} can be modeled by a simplified setup of a single magnetized, ferromagnetic wire which is surrounded by the flowing particle suspension. %welches von der Partikelsuspension umströmt wird  

\subsection{Magnetic field in the vicinity of a magnetized wire}
\label{subsec:mag_field}
The magnetic field $H(r,\varphi)$ in the vicinity of a infinitely long cylinder, which is magnetized by a homogeneous magnetic field $H_{0}$ (configuration shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:wire}), is described by the following Equation\,\ref{eq:mag_field_strat}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mag_field_strat}
\centering
H = H_{0}(e_{r}cos\varphi-e_{\varphi}sin\varphi)+H_{0}\frac{a^{2}}{r^{2}}\left(\frac{\mu_{w}-\mu_{f}}{\mu_{w}+\mu_{f}}\right)(e_{r}cos\varphi+e_{\varphi}sin\varphi)
\end{equation}

where $e_{r}$ and $e_{\varphi}$ are the unit vectors in the polar coordinate system and $\mu_{w}$ and $\mu_{f}$ depict the magnetic permeability of the wire and the fluid, respectively \cite{stratton2007electromagnetic}. For an external field $H_{0}$, that is strong enough to magnetize the wire to saturation, and a surrounding medium with a permeability close to one, e.g. water or air, Equation\,\ref{eq:mag_field_strat} can be written as follows in Equation\,\ref{eq:Hr_field} and \ref{eq:Hphi_field}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Hr_field}
\centering
H_{r} = \left(\frac{M_{s,w}a^{2}}{2r^{2}}+H_{0}\right)cos\varphi
\end{equation}

\label{eq:Hphi_field}
\centering
H_{\varphi} = \left(\frac{M_{s,w}a^{2}}{2r^{2}}-H_{0}\right)sin\varphi
\end{equation}

where $a$ is the radius of the wire and $r$ is the distance between the wire and the magnetic nanoparticle \cite{FranzrebHabil}. The magnetic field of a magnetized ferromagnetic wire is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:mag_field_wire}. The magnetic force $F_{m}$ affecting the particles can then be calculated from the magnetic field with Equation\,\ref{eq:mag_force} \cite{moeser2004high}.

\subsection{Magnetic particle accumulation on single wires}
\label{subsec:single_wire}
For micron-size particles or larger, the capture process in \gls{hgms} can be simplified by the analysis of a single magnetized collector and the particle trajectories in its vicinity. Figure\,\ref{fig:wire} depicts the configuration of particle capture in a single wire model.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\scalebox{0.3}{\includegraphics{figures/Single_wire.png}}
\caption[Configuration of particle capture in a single wire model]{Configuration of particle capture in a single wire model: A cylindrical ferromagnetic wire with the radius $a$, which is magnetized to saturation by an external magnetic field $H_{0}$, a paramagnetic particle with the radius $b$ at a distance $r$ from the wire and a polar angle of $\theta$ from the wire center and the fluid flow velocity $v_{0}$ \cite{svoboda2004magnetic}
\label{fig:wire}
}
\end{figure}

For a single wire model three different orientations of the wire relative to the flow and applied field are considered. It is assumed that the magnetic field is always orthogonal to the ferromagnetic wire. The direction of the fluid flow can then be either parallel (longitudinal) or perpendicular (transversal) to the direction of the magnetic field. In addition, the fluid flow can be oriented parallel to the wire, which is referred to as axial configuration \cite{friedlaender1978particle}. The particle build-up profiles for the three different orientations are shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:hgms_config}.   

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering

\caption[Geometric configurations in HGMS and particle build-up]{Schematic drawing of the three main geometric configurations in HGMS and the corresponding profiles of the particle build-up in a ferromagnetic wire; arrangements between the directions of the magnetic field $H_{0}$ and the particle flow velocity $v_{0}$ with respect to the wire (top) and the cross section of the wire (hatched area) with the particle build-up profile corresponding to the respective configuration \cite{svoboda2004magnetic}
\label{fig:hgms_config}
}
\end{figure}

The particle trajectories in the vicinity of the wire are calculated by Newton's second law, which states that the sum of all forces affecting the particle is equal to the product of the particle mass $m$ and its acceleration $a_{p}$. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mag_force_sum}
\centering
\sum_{i}\boldsymbol{F}_{i} = m\boldsymbol{a}_{p}
\end{equation}
 
The forces acting on the particles e.g. the magnetic, gravitational and hydrodynamic force are described in Section\,\ref{subsec:bas_princ}. Whether a particle is collected by the wire or not can be determined by following the particle trajectory. If the particle trajectory ends on the wire's surface, the particle is separated, if, however, the particle trajectory passes the wire the particle remains in suspension \cite{FranzrebHabil}. A model for particle trajectories with a sphere instead of a wire can be found in \cite{friedlaender1981particle,moyer1986filtration}.
 
In the case of ultra-fine magnetic particles, where the diffusion outweighs the other forces, the trajectory analysis is not suitable. In this case, the continuity equation representing the conservation of mass with the influence of external forces on individual magnetic particles expressed through the flux term is solved \cite{choomphon2017simulation}. In a two-dimensional model spherical and cylindrical collectors are show the same results. The solution of the continuity equation, describing the time-dependent distribution of the magnetic particles around the collector, can be written as follows in Equation \ref{eq:diff_eq}:     

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff_eq}
\centering
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = \nabla\cdotp(D\nabla n)-\nabla\cdotp(n v_{p})
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the particle number density, $D$ the diffusion coefficient and $v_{p}$ the particle drift velocity caused by the magnetic force $F_{m}$ for spherical particles at low Reynolds numbers \cite{fletcher1991fine,FranzrebHabil}. $D$ is determined by the Stokes-Einstein relation (see Section\,\ref{subsec:bas_princ}). For a steady-state, i.e. ${\partial n}/{\partial t}$=0, Equation\,\ref{eq:diff_eq} reduces to:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff_eq_2}
\centering
 D\nabla n = n v_{p}
\end{equation}

which describes the dynamic balance between an inward flux of the particles towards the wire and an outward flux due to Brownian motion \cite{fletcher1991fine}.

% \label{sec:Dim_helm_coil}
% A Helmholtz coil produces an approximately uniform magnetic field along the x-axis between the coils. The dimensioning of the coil is based on the Biot-Savart law, which describes the magentic field generated by a stationary electric current. The magnetic flux density in a cylindrical coil with only one winding can be calculated with Equation \ref{eq:one_winding}.

\section{Computational fluid dynamics}
\label{sec:CFD}
\Gls{cfd} is a well established method in fluid mechanics. It enables a quick and efficient analysis of fluid flows. Formerly mainly used for numerical weather prediction or calculations concerning the aerodynamics of airplanes, it has now become a vital component in process and
product development in many different aspects of engineering. Applications vary from chemical process and civil engineering to biomedical and pharmaceutical
process and product design. CFD offers an inexpensive alternative or addition to experimental approaches as well as the possibility to study systems in which experiments would be unfeasible. Other main advantages include the reduced time, parallel processing and the almost unlimited level of detail of the results. The progress in both hardware and numerical algorithms in the past decades has led to the development of numerous commercial and open-source CFD programs \cite{ghia1982high}. In this work a numerical model using the COMSOL Multiphysics  software (COMSOL Inc., Stockholm, Sweden), which is a predominantly finite element analysis, solver and simulation package specialized for coupled phenomena and multiphysics, was developed.

\subsection{Navier-Stokes equations}
\label{subsec:Navier_Stokes}
The Navier-Stokes equations are a macroscopic model of the motion of viscous fluids and the basis of the fluid-dynamic calculations of COMSOL. Analytical solutions only exist for simplified versions of the Navier-Stokes equations e.g. Couette flow and Hagen-Poiseuille flow. For more complex, nonlinear problems like the setup in this thesis the equations need to be solved numerically. The Navier-Stokes equations in their most general form for a compressible fluid can be written as follows in Equations \ref{eq:Conservation of momentum 1}, \ref{eq:Conservation of mass 1} and \ref{eq:Conservation of energy 1}:

% \begin{equation}
% \rho\frac{\partial \boldsymbol u}{\partial t} + \rho\boldsymbol u\cdotp\nabla\boldsymbol u - \left(\mu(\nabla\boldsymbol u+(\nabla\boldsymbol u)^{T})-\frac{2}{3}\mu(\nabla\cdotp\boldsymbol u)\boldsymbol I\right) + \nabla p = \boldsymbol F
% \label{eq:Conservation of momentum 1}
% \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\rho\frac{\partial \boldsymbol u}{\partial t} + \rho\boldsymbol u\cdotp\nabla\boldsymbol u - \nabla\cdotp[-p\boldsymbol I + \boldsymbol \tau] = \boldsymbol F
\label{eq:Conservation of momentum 1}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla(\rho\boldsymbol u) = 0
\label{eq:Conservation of mass 1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\rho C_{p}\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}+(\boldsymbol u \cdotp\nabla)T\right) = -(\nabla\cdotp\boldsymbol q)+\tau:\boldsymbol S -\frac{T}{\rho}\left.\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}\right\vert_{p}\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}+(\boldsymbol u\cdotp\nabla)p\right)+Q 
\label{eq:Conservation of energy 1}
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the density in kg/m\textsuperscript{3}, $\boldsymbol u$ is the velocity in m/s, $p$ is the pressure in Pa, $\tau$ is the viscous stress tensor in Pa, $\boldsymbol I$ is the unit vector, $\boldsymbol F$ is the volume force vector in N/m\textsuperscript{3}. $C_{p}$ is the specific heat capacity in at constant pressure in J/(kg$\cdotp$K), $T$ is the absolute Temperature in K, $\boldsymbol q$ is the heat flux vector in W/m\textsuperscript{2}, $Q$ describes the heat sources in W/m\textsuperscript{3} and $\boldsymbol S$ is the strain-rate tensor \cite{ComsolRefManual}. The Navier-Stokes Equations (see Equation\,\ref{eq:Conservation of momentum 1}) satisfy the conservation of momentum, while the continuity equation (see Equation\,\ref{eq:Conservation of mass 1} represents the conservation of mass. Equation\,\ref{eq:Conservation of energy 1} describes the conservation of energy formulated in terms of temperature. The double dot product describes the contraction between two tensors. The strain-rate tensor can be calculated by the expression in Equation\,\ref{eq:strain_tensor}\cite{ComsolRefManual}.

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol S = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\boldsymbol u+(\nabla\boldsymbol u)^{T})
\label{eq:strain_tensor}
\end{equation}

Newtonian fluids are a simple mathematical model for the description of fluids that accounts for viscosity. While no real fluid fits the definition perfectly, many common liquids and gases, such as water and air, are assumed to be Newtonian for practical calculations. Newtonian fluids exhibit a linear correlation between the viscous stress, arising from its flow, and the local strain-rate, which is described by Equation\,\ref{eq:stress_tensor}, where $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity in Pa$\cdotp$s. The strain rate tensor describes the rate of change of the deformation of the fluid element caused by the viscous stress forces.

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\tau = 2\mu\boldsymbol S - \frac{2}{3}\mu(\nabla\cdotp\boldsymbol u)\boldsymbol I
\label{eq:stress_tensor}
\end{equation}

For incompressible Newtonian fluids, like water or alcohol, the Equations\,\ref{eq:Conservation of momentum 1} and \ref{eq:Conservation of mass 1} are reduced to Equations\,\ref{eq:Conservation of momentum } and \ref{eq:Conservation of mass }\cite{versteeg2007introduction}. 

\begin{equation}
{\partial{\boldsymbol u}\over{\partial t}} + ({\boldsymbol u} \cdot \nabla) {\boldsymbol u} - \nu\Delta{\boldsymbol u}+ \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p = {\boldsymbol F}
\label{eq:Conservation of momentum }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\nabla{\boldsymbol u} = 0
\label{eq:Conservation of mass }
\end{equation}
 
The first term of Equation\,\ref{eq:Conservation of momentum } describes the local acceleration of the fluid, $({\boldsymbol u} \cdot \nabla) {\boldsymbol u}$ the non-linear convective term, representing the inertial forces, $\nabla p$ the pressure gradient and $\nu\Delta{\boldsymbol u}$ the dissipative viscous term. The Navier-Stokes equations are always solved together with the continuity equation (see Equation\,\ref{eq:Conservation of mass }).
 
%The Navier-Stokes equations satisfy the conservation of momentum, while mass conservation is included through the continuity equation \cite{alkahtani2013numerical}.
Fluid flows can also be characterized by the dimensionless Reynolds number, which is used to predict the flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. The Reynolds number is defined as the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces and can be written as follows (Equation\,\ref{eq:Reynolds}):  

\begin{equation}
Re=\frac{\rho u L}{\mu}=\frac{uL}{\nu}
\label{eq:Reynolds}
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the fluid density in kg/m\textsuperscript{3} and $L$ is a characteristic linear dimension in m, e.g. the hydraulic diameter of a pipe. For a low Reynolds number the flow condition will be laminar, while for higher Reynolds numbers, above approximately 2300 for a flow in a circular pipe, turbulent flow occurs \cite{schwarze2012cfd}. Flows where Re is much smaller than one are referred to as Stokes flow or creeping flow. Here the viscous forces are much larger than the inertial forces which is usually caused by either very low velocities or small characteristic lengths, f.e. in microfluidics. Stokes flow also occurs in highly viscous fluids such as heavy oils or honey \cite{lautrup2004physics}. Figure\,\ref{fig:creep_tot} shows creeping flow around a cylinder, with its characteristic streamlines, that are parallel to the surface of the cylinder as a schematic drawing and in reality. A turbulent flow around the same cylinder, which would occur e.g. for large u, would appear less ordered and contain eddies or swirls.

\subsection{Space and time discretization methods}
\label{subsec:FEM}
Space and time dependent physical problems are usually described with the help of \glspl{pde} in a domain $\Omega$. Most of these \glspl{pde} cannot be solved with analytical methods, but an approximation of the equations based on different types of discretizations can be obtained. \Gls{fem} is a numerical technique for constructing such approximate solutions for \glspl{pde}. The principle of the method is to replace an entire continuous domain by a number of finite-sized subdomains, called elements, of geometrically simple shapes like tetrahedrons or triangular prisms. Together the elements constitute a finite-element mesh. The \glspl{pde} for each element are approximated by an interpolation function, such as a linear, quadratic or higher order polynomial, also referred to as basis function, with a finite number of degrees of freedom. In combination with the boundary conditions a  system of algebraic equations is obtained, which can be solved by a sparse matrix solver \cite{john2016finite}. The solution of the matrix results in an approximate solution of the \glspl{pde}. The accuracy of the solution can be increased by a refinement of the finite-element mesh or an increased order of the basis function. An example of the approximation of a function $u$ by the function $u_{h}$ consisting of linear combinations of basis functions $\psi_{i}$ with the coefficients $u_{i}$ (see Equation\,\ref{eq:FEM}) is depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:FEM}. 

\begin{equation}
u\approx u_{h} \quad \textrm{with} \quad u_{h}=\sum_{i}u_{i}\psi_{i}
\label{eq:FEM}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\scalebox{0.3}{\includegraphics{figures/FEM.png}}
\caption[Approximation of a function with FEM]{Approximation of the function $u$ (solid blue line) by the function $u_{h}$ (dashed red line), where $u_{h}$ is a combination of linear interpolation functions $\psi_{i}$ (solid black lines) and the coefficients $u_{0}$ to $u_{7}$ \cite{ComsolFEM}
\label{fig:FEM}
}
\end{figure}

Overall \gls{fem} for the approximation of \glspl{pde} can be divided into four steps: discretization of the domain, selection of the interpolation functions, formulation of the system equations and solution of the system equations. 
 
\Gls{fem} can also be applied for a time domain, this can, however, come at the cost of a high computational effort. Therefore simple time-stepping methods based on finite differences are frequently used for time discretization. The implicit time-stepping algorithm used in this work is the \gls{bdf} solver, which uses backward differentiation formulas with the order of accuracy varying from one, known as the backward Euler method, to five. \gls{bdf} solvers exhibit a high stability, but also include more damping effects than comparable solvers based on e.g. generalized alpha or Runge-Kutta methods \cite{ComsolRefManual}.

\section{Analysis of peak asymmetry}
\label{sec:peak_as}
Chromatography is a technique commonly used for the separation of components of a mixture. There are many different types of chromatography e.g. liquide and gas chromatography. The principal of chromatographic separation is based on the different affinities of the mixture components towards a stationary phase, which can be either solid or liquide, and a mobile phase, which can be either liquide or gaseous. The differences in the rates of movement from the different mixture components lead to a separation over the length of the stationary phase, which is often placed in a column. A chromatogram is basically the output of a chromatography run measured at the end of the column. The chromatogram depicts different peaks which correspond to the separated mixture components. In liquide chromatography, the peak shape is an important quality characteristic, as it can be used to extract basic performance parameters such as the peak height, area, resolution and asymmetry. These parameters allow a prediction of the separation properties of the respective process. In order to predict the quality of the packed bed of a chromatographic column peaks produced by tracer molecules are examined. As tracer substances with no interaction with either the mobile or the solid phase are chosen. For the experimental setup in this thesis mainly the retention time, peak area and asymmetry were evaluated (for more information on the setup and evaluation methods see Section\,\ref{sec:Exp_setup}). In the following, the asymmetry of chromatographic peaks is further discussed. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\scalebox{0.6}{\includegraphics{figures/Peak_param.pdf}}
\caption[Idealized chromatographic peak]{Idealized chromatographic peak: Measurement of the retention time $t_{R}$ and the asymmetry factor $A_{s}=b/a$ at 10\,\% peak height $h_{10}$ 
\label{fig:peak_param}
}
\end{figure} 

An idealized chromatographic peak with a Gaussian profile is depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:peak_param}. As most real chromatographic peaks are not symmetrical, an asymmetry factor $A_{s}$ is introduced to characterize the peak shape and to evaluate the quality of the packed bed. The asymmetry can be empirically determined by $A_{s}=b/a$, where $a$ is the partial peak width of the first part, measured at a certain percentage of the peak height and $b$ is the partial peak width for the second part of the peak, also measured at the same percentage of height. $A_{s}$ is usually measured at 10\,\% of the peak height from the base line as for Gaussian and near Gaussian peaks it results in much more accurate values with lower standard deviations as compared to measurements at 5, 30 or 50\,\% \cite{foley1983equations}. The Gaussian standard deviation of the asymmetrical peak can be estimated with Equation \ref{eq:Gaus_dev}, where $w_{10}=a+b$ is the peak width at $h_{10}$ \cite{papai2002analysis}.  

\begin{equation}
\sigma=\frac{w_{10}}{3.27 b/a + 1.2}
\label{eq:Gaus_dev}
\end{equation}

The peak shape for values of $A_{s} < 1$ is called fronting and for values of $A_{s} > 1$ tailing. Tailing is e.g. caused by dead volume in the flow path or the column packing, while fronting can arise from channeling in poorly packed columns. Therefore $A_{s}$ is a suitable indicator of the quality of the packed bed. As almost all chromatographic peaks tail to some extent, an acceptable range for $A_{s}$ has to be defined for each column and application individually \cite{SWB-414874366}.

% \section{Simulated moving bed chromatography}
% \label{sec:smb}
% The overall goal of the research project this thesis is embedded in is to develop a continuous size fractionation process for magnetic nanoparticles at industrial scale. \Gls{smb} is a continuous countercurrent chromatography method, which was developed in the late 1950s by engineers from Universal Oil Products to separate p-xylene from its isomers \cite{broughton1961continuous,carson1962rotary}. The invention of the continuous process was mainly motivated by the need to produce large quantities of chemicals at high purity in a comparatively short time. Since the 1990s \gls{smb} is increasingly used in other industries than petrochemistry, e.g. cane and beet molasse separation in the sugar industry or the production of enantiomerically pure drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. The principle of countercurrent chromatography is depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:SMBTurtle}. The process of separation of two components can be illustrated by picturing a fast cat and a slow turtle running on a conveyor belt that is moving in the opposite direction. The velocity of the cat is larger than and the velocity of the turtle is smaller than the velocity of the conveyor. Therefore the cat will move to the right side, while the turtle is dragged to the left side of the band and thus they are separated \cite{rajendran2009simulated}.

% 
% The same separation of components is achieved in a continouse countercurrent chromatography column, where both the fluid and the solid are pumped into opposite directions. The component mixture is fed continuously to the middle of the column and the two seperated components are collected on either side of the column \cite{deckert1994simulierte}. As pumping of the solid phase is neither easy to achieve nor practicable the column is substituted by several seperate columns and the movement of the bed is simulated by either moving the columns on a caroussle like structure or switching of the inlet and outlet flows with rotray valves \cite{SWB-414874366}. A schematic four column setup for a \gls{smb} process is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:SMB}.

% With this setup a continuous binary separation of a mixture can be achieved with high purity and yield.

The objective of this thesis is the design, implementation and validation of an in silico model simulating the retention of magnetic nanoparticles flowing through a simplified magnetized packed bed. The model is based on a single wire model for the simulation of dynamic particle capture, which was kindly provided by A. Ebner (a detailed description of the model can be found in \cite{choomphon2017simulation}). Furthermore, parameter studies for various conditions were conducted. In the following, the simulation setup including geometry, mesh and solvers (see Section\,\ref{subsec:geom}), as well as the model parameters (Section\,\ref{subsec:Cond_param}) and the principal equations and boundary conditions (Section\,\ref{subsec:model_eq_BC}), are described. Furthermore, a description of the performed parameter studies is given in Section\,\ref{subsec:Param_studies}.     

\subsection{Geometry and mesh}
\label{subsec:geom}
The geometry of the the two-dimensional single wire model as shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:geom_singlewire}, consists of two subregions: the magnetized wire (displayed by the inner cylinder) and the surrounding fluid (in gray). The wire is located at the center of a rectangular channel, through which a nanoparticle suspension flows with an average inlet velocity of $u_{0}$. The applied magnetic field $H_{0}$ is oriented in the same direction as the flow velocity. This longitudinal arrangement was chosen, as it matches the conditions in the experimental setup. In order to evaluate the retention of the nanoparticles close to the cylinder, a circular domain was included around the wire in which the particle residence time was determined (see Section\,\ref{subsec:Param_studies}).

For the generation of the mesh, the COMSOL method of physics-controlled meshing with free triangular elements, was applied. Hereby, information from the physics interface is used to set up an appropriate mesh sequence. The different mesh sizes are specified by COMSOL with adjectives such as coarse, normal, fine or finer. As COMSOL mainly uses \gls{fem}, the accuracy of the solution is linked to the mesh size (for more information see Section\,\ref{subsec:FEM}). The smaller the mesh size the closer the approximation matches the exact solution of the \glspl{pde}. A decrease in element size, however, is always accompanied by an increase in computational effort. Therefore, a mesh refinement study was conducted with the goal to minimize the difference between the exact and the approximated solution, while still retaining reasonably low computing times. The residence time of the particles measured at the outflow was chosen as characteristic output parameter. As convergence criterion a deviation of the residence time smaller than 1.5\,\% from the current mesh to the next finer mesh was chosen. The different meshes tested in the refinement study are shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:Mesh_Ref} and the corresponding mesh size parameters are listed in Table\,\ref{table:Mesh_Ref}.

In addition to the two-dimensional single wire model, geometries with two and four wires were constructed. The setup and the meshing for those geometries are shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:Two_Four_Wires}. To assure comparability, the resulting mesh size from the mesh refinement study from the single wire model was chosen.

For the two and four cylinder setup a channel with the same geometric dimensions as shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:geom_singlewire} was used. For the two cylinder setup, the centers of the wires with the radius $R_{w}$ are located at at a distance of 2$R_{w}$ on the x-axis in each direction from the center of the channel. For the four cylinder setup, the cylinder centers are positioned at a distance of 3.5\,$R_{w}$ and 1.15\,$R_{w}$ respectively on each side of the channel center. For those two configurations, $R_{w}$ was fixed on 25\,\textmu m, while $R_{w}$ for the single wire model was also varied in the parameter studies described in Section\,\ref{subsec:Param_studies}. The retention of the magnetic nanoparticles was evaluated in the rectangle, drawn around the cylinders and at the outflow of the channel. To achieve a high resolution, the relative tolerance for all simulations was set to 0.001 for the stationary part and to 0.01 for the time-dependent part. This means that the solver stops its iterations once the relative tolerance exceeds the relative error computed as the weighted Euclidean norm. In addition, the step width used by the \gls{bdf} solver was set to intermediate with an event tolerance of 0.01 and an initial step width of 0.001\,s. As sparse matrix solver the \gls{mumps} is used in the magnetic fields interface, while the \gls{pardiso} is used in the general form of the \gls{pde} interface (for more information on the linear system solvers see \cite{ComsolRefManual}).

\subsection{Model equations and boundary conditions}
\label{subsec:model_eq_BC}
In this section, a brief overview of the model equations and conditions is given. A more detailed model description can be found in \cite{choomphon2017simulation}. The external magnetic field was simulated with the magnetic fields interface of the AC/DC branch of COMSOL. It solves Maxwell's equations (see Section\,\ref{subsec:Maxwell}) formulated with the magnetic vector potential as described in Section\,\ref{subsec:Mag_pot}. In this model, the stationary Equations \ref{eq:Ampere_stat} and \ref{eq:Pot_A} are solved for each domain together with the constitutive relation, described in Equation\,\ref{eq:B_tot} and the necessary material properties like $\mu_{r}$. The material properties are based on the assigned material for each domain. As initial condition, the magnetic vector potential is set to zero for all domains.  As boundary condition, magnetic insulation is applied to all four channel boundaries. The magnetic insulation boundary condition sets the tangential components of the magnetic potential to zero at the boundary ($\boldsymbol{n}\times\boldsymbol{A} = 0$). More information on the magnetic fields interface and corresponding equations and boundary conditions can be found in the COMSOL AC/DC module user guide \cite{ComsolACDC}. 

The fluid flowing through the channel consists of a slurry containing magnetic nanoparticles with the radius $R_{p}$ and water. The nanoparticles are composed of magnetite and a diamagnetic polymer. The model was constructed in a way to include the effects of the particle accumulation on the wire both on the fluid flow and the magnetic field. To achieve this, the fluid viscosity is defined as a function of the magnetic particle concentration and the external forces are set to zero once the particles are collected, indicated by the maximum particle concentration. The velocity and the concentration of the slurry are described by the two-dimensional unsteady state Navier-Stokes equations for compressible fluid flow (see also Section\,\ref{subsec:Navier_Stokes}). The Equations \ref{eq:NS_part1} and \ref{eq:NS_part2} depict the Navier-Stokes equations for the solid (magnetic particles) and the liquid (water) fraction, respectively \cite{choomphon2017simulation}.

$v_{s}=(v_{s,x},v_{s,y})$ denotes the velocity of the solid, while  $v_{l}=(v_{l,x},v_{l,y})$ is the velocity of the liquid. $\phi$ is the particle volume fraction in the fluid and $\mu(\phi)$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, that is dependent on $\phi$. $\Phi(\phi)$ is a constraint function that approaches a value of zero when $\phi$ approaches its maximum value, which leads to the cancellation of all forces once the particles are collected. The continuity equations for the liquid and the particle phase can be written as follows:  

\begin{equation}
\frac{d\rho_{s}}{d t}+\nabla\cdotp(\rho_{s}V_{s})=0
\label{eq:Conti_p}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{d\rho_{l}}{d t}+\nabla\cdotp(\rho_{l}V_{l})=0
\label{eq:Conti_l}
\end{equation}

where the solid and liquid densities can be defined as $\rho_{s}=\phi\rho_{p}$ and $\rho_{l}=(1-\phi)\rho_{w}$ with $\rho_{p}$ as the density of a single particle and $\rho_{w}$ as the density of water. The equations are implemented in the general form \gls{pde} interface.\\
As the magnetic particles are assumed to be in the nanometer range (for values of $R_{p}$ see Section\,\ref{subsec:Param_studies}) only magnetic, hydrodynamic and diffusion forces are considered and the gravitational force is neglected. For calculation of the forces the Equations \ref{eq:mag_force}, \ref{eq:drag_force} and \ref{eq:diff_force} are modified in the following way as shown in Equation\, \ref{eq:mag_force_model}, \ref{eq:drag_force_model} and \ref{eq:diff_force_model}.  

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mag_force_model}
\centering
\boldsymbol{F}_{m} = \frac{1}{2}\mu_{0}V_{p}\omega_{fmp}\nabla(\boldsymbol{M}_{fmp}\boldsymbol{H_{f}})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:drag_force_model}
\centering
\boldsymbol{F}_{d} = 6\pi\mu(\phi)R_{p}(\boldsymbol{v}_{l}-\boldsymbol{v}_{s})
\end{equation}

\boldsymbol{F}_{B}=

                    -k_{B}T\frac{\nabla\phi}{\phi} & \text{if}\ \phi>0 \\
                    0 & \text{if}\ \phi=0
                 \end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\omega_{fmp}$ is the volume fraction of the magnetite in the magnetic particles, $M_{fmp}$ is the magnetization of the particles and $H_{f}$ is the local magnetic field around the wire, which is defined by Equation\, \ref{eq:loc_mag_field}. Herein $\varphi_{2}$ is the magnetic potential in the liquid domain and $H_{0}$ the externally applied uniform magnetic field. The induced magnetization in the wire  by $H_{0}$ is described by the following Equation\,\ref{eq:mag_wire}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:loc_mag_field}
\centering
H_{f}=H_{0}-\nabla\varphi_{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mag_wire}

\boldsymbol{M}_{w}= 
                 \begin{cases}
                    \frac{2\chi_{w,0}}{2+\chi_{w,0}}H_{0} & \text{if}\ \frac{2\chi_{w,0}}{2+\chi_{w,0}}H_{0}<M_{w,s} \\
                    \frac{M_{w,s}}{H_{0}}H_{0} & \text{if}\ \frac{2\chi_{w,0}}{2+\chi_{w,0}}H_{0}\geq M_{w,s} \\
                 \end{cases}
\end{equation}

No-slip and no-flux boundary conditions are applied at the wire's surface as it is assumed that the fluid velocity at the solid boundary will have zero velocity relative to the boundary and cannot pass through the solid boundary. Periodic boundary conditions or Dirichlet boundary conditions with a fixed flow velocity are applied at the channel walls. The boundary conditions on the channel walls were selected in order to model a chromatographic column with far more than just one cylinder in a channel. A Dirichlet boundary condition of $p$=0 was set at the outflow to simulate an open-boundary flow with an ambient pressure of zero and an inflow velocity $u_{0}$ was set at the inflow.


\subsection{Parameter studies}
\label{subsec:Param_studies} 
In order to evaluate the influence of the different parameters on the retention of the magnetic nanoparticles, parameter studies were conducted. For these parameter studies, the following parameters were varied: the magnetic flux density of the external field $B_{0}$ in mT, the particle radius $R_{p}$ in nm, the radius of the wire $R_{w}$ in \textmu m and the inflow velocity of the slurry $u_{0}$ in \textmu m/s. For the two and four cylinder models $R_{w}$ was held constant. The design of the parameter studies is shown in Table\,\ref{table:param_study} with the corresponding value ranges of the varied parameters.

\end{table}

The flow and magnetic conditions were simulated for 10\,s for each case, where the nanoparticles were introduced in a constant concentration into the domain between 0.1\,s and 0.2\,s after the start of the simulation. As characteristic parameter the residence time of the particles is determined in the secondary circle around the wire and at the outflow as shown in Equation\,\ref{eq:residence_time}. For the two and four cylinder setup, the residence time of the particles is determined within the rectangle around the wires and at the outflow of the channel. The residence time is then normalized by the division with the residence time at 0\,mT and otherwise unchanged parameters.

\section{Experimental setup}
\label{sec:Exp_setup}
For the validation of the simulation results and as a proof of principle of the operational concept several experimental runs were designed. In order to evaluate the retention of a magnetic nanoparticle suspension within a magnetizable packed bed a chromatographic system was used (see Section\,\ref{subsec:chrom_sys}). The nanoparticle suspension is characterized in Section\,\ref{subsec:Mag_nanoparticles} and the matrix materials in Section\,\ref{subsec:Matrix_mat}. Furthermore an overview of the conducted experiments is given in Section\,\ref{subsec:Exp_Pro}. In Section\,\ref{subsec:ana_met} the analytical methods and in Section\,\ref{subsec:Eval} the evaluation methods are discussed.    


\subsection{Magnetic nanoparticle suspension}
\label{subsec:Mag_nanoparticles}
The experiments were conducted with two different types of magnetic nanoparticles. For the experiments in Section\,\ref{subsec:Exp_Pro} a nanoparticle suspension from Chemagen (Chemagen Biopolymer Technology, Baesweiler, Germany) was used. The magnetic nanoparticles from Chemagen consist of a core of magnetite coated with \gls{pva}. A stock solution with a concentration of 73\,g/l was used. In order to minimize aggregation, the stock solution was put into an ultrasonic bath (Branson 2200, Emerson Electric Co., St.Louis, USA) for 20 minutes before use. Then the stock solution was diluted 1:100 with 20\,mM sodium phosphate buffer (MERCK, Darmstadt, Germany) with a pH of 6.5 and filtered through a filter with a pore size of 450\,nm.
 
In addition,  plain nanomag\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-D-spio particles from Micromod (Micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH, Rostock, Germany) with mean diameters of 20\,nm and 100\,nm were utilized for the experiments. The Micromod nanoparticles are composed of iron oxid domains coated by an unmodified dextran surface. The stock solution with a concentration of 25\,g/l was also diluted 1:100 with a 20\,mM phosphate buffer. In addition, a 1:1 mixture of the two nanoparticle sizes was used. In contrast to the Chemagen nanoparticles, the Micromod particles required no additional ultrasonic treatment and filtration in order to remove aggregates.     

\subsection{Matrix material}
\label{subsec:Matrix_mat}
For the packed bed three different matrix materials were evaluated. In Table\,\ref{table:mat_material} the three magnetizable materials and their corresponding composition are listed.    

\begin{table}[H]

\end{table}

The matrix material SRA-150, from now on only referred to as SRA-150, was already used in preceding experiments by \cite{AndreMaster}. In order to achieve a narrow particle-size distribution the SRA-150 particles were sieved with a mesh size of 25\,\textmu m and 20\,\textmu m respectively. In addition the matrix materials TruForm 316-3 was chosen due to its spherical structure and material composition. 
As a negative control \gls{pmma} particles from microParticles GmbH were used.  

\subsection{Column packing}
\label{subsec:col_pack}
As chromatographic column an Omnifit\textsuperscript{\textregistered} BenchMark\textsuperscript{TM} Microbore chromatography column (Omnifit Labware, Diba Industries, Danbury, USA) was used. The borosilicate glass column has a column length of 10\,mm, a column inside diameter of 3\,mm and a total volume capacity of 0.7\,ml. On both sides of the column end pieces with pre-assembled frits were used to hold back the matrix material. For the experiments with \gls{pmma} and SRA-150 \gls{ptfe} frits with a pore size of 25\,\textmu m were used. In addition punched out polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 2\,\textmu m and an O-ring were added to the inlet and outlet of the column. For the experiments with the TruForm 316-3 matrix material \gls{ptfe} frits with a pore size of 5\,\textmu m were used, no additional filters were necessary. 

For the column packing a slurry consisting of the matrix material and either ultra-pure water for \gls{pmma} or a 20\,\% Ethanol suspension for SRA-150 and TruForm 316-3 was used. Ethanol was used in order to simplify the packing of the column due to the reduced surface tension. To remove impurities and achieve a narrower particle size distribution the \gls{pmma} matrix material was first mixed with the solvent and left to settle for several minutes. After sedimentation the supernatant was removed and replaced by fresh solvent. This procedure was repeated till the supernatant was a clear fluid. For the other two matrix materials instead of sedimentation a magnet was held to the outside of the falcon to separate the magnetizable particles from the supernatant.

A CETONI neMESYS syringe pump (CETONI GmbH, Korbussen, Germany), controlled by a QmixElements software, was connected to bottom of the column via a tube (see Figure\,\ref{fig:Packing_Setup_Column}). With this setup a negative pressure was generated within the column into which the matrix material slurry is drawn from the column inlet. The slurry was added to the column inlet by a pipette. Once the column was completely filled, the syringe pump was disconnected and the end piece with the corresponding frit or filter was placed on top of the column. Then the packed bed within the column was compressed with the help of an \gls{fplc}-system (described in Section\,\ref{subsec:chrom_sys}) to eliminate possible cavities. Afterwards the column was again connected to the syringe pump and the resulting void at the top filled with new matrix material. This procedure was repeated until no further compression of the matrix material could be observed. The column and the syringe pump are shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:Packing_Setup_Column}.

\subsection{Chromatographic system}
\label{subsec:chrom_sys}
For the compression of the packed bed within the column and the execution of the retention experiments an Äkta purifier \gls{fplc}-system from GE Healthcare (Buckinghamshire, England) was used. For all connections tubings with an inner diameter of 0.25\,mm (PEEK tubings blue, GE Healtcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) were used to reduce axial dispersion in order to achieve high resolution peaks. The samples were injected via a sample loop with a total volume of 100\,\textmu m. The experiments were conducted with ultra-pure water as mobile phase and a constant flow rate. An inline UV flow cell was used to continuously measure the absorbance of the liquid at a wavelength of 280 nm. A conductivity flow cell was used to measure the conductivity of the passing solution. For further analysis the injected samples were collected by a fraction collector after they had passed the column and the detectors. The regulation of the \gls{fplc}-system and the analysis of the transmitted data was realized by the software Unicorn 5.20 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, England). The experimental setup is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:  }.

\subsubsection{Chromatographic system with a Helmholtz coil}
\label{subsubsec:helm_coil}
For all experiments a Helmholtz coil was used to create a stable homogeneous magnetic field around the column. The Helmholtz coil consists of an assembly of four coils with the distance D between each other. The whole length of the four coils was based on the length of the column. The other calculated dimensions of the Helmholtz coil can be found in Table\,\ref{table:Helmholtz_coil} (more detailed information on the dimensioning of Helmholtz coils can be found in \cite{wotruba1968verbesserung,wotruba1969massive,heller1955erzeugung}). The Helmholtz coil was constructed so that for a current of 2\,A a magnetic field of 14\,mT was created in the center of the coils. In order to achieve homogeneous magnetic field strength over the whole length the two inner coils were constructed with a lower number of turns. The coil was also designed to be used in an ultrasonic bath. The technical drawing for the construction of the used Helmholtz coil is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:Helmholtz_coil}\\  
The Helmholtz coil was included in the chromatographic system as shown in Figure\,\ref{fig: ???}. The coil was connected to a power amplifier (19 Z/500, FG Elektronik, Rüttersdorf, Germany) to increase the electrical signal and therefore the magnetic field within the coil. The electric signals were generated by a function generator (Rigol DG1022, RIGOL Technologies Inc., Beijing, China). The adjustment of the magnetic flux density was achieved by the regulation of the electric current measured with a digital multimeter (MY64, Mastech Group LLC., CA, USA). The homogeneity of the magnetic field within the coil was tested with a hall effect sensor described in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:Hall_eff}.

\subsection{Experimental procedures}
\label{subsec:Exp_Pro}
All experiments were programmed and regulated using the control software Unicorn. Before each injection the column was washed with 2\,ml of ultra-pure water to remove possible remaining nanoparticles from the previous injection. To achieve comparability and reproducibility all experiments were conducted with the same method, except for the fractionation and saturation experiments ,for which a separate method was created. All experiments were done in triple determination. \\
Before each experiment series the quality of the column packing was controlled. For this purpose a one percent acetone solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, USA) was injected and the asymmetry of the  resulting UV peak analyzed. For a packing with \gls{pmma} an asymmetry between 1 and 2 and for a packing with the TruForm particles an asymmetry between 1 and 1.5 was considered tolerable. For deviating asymmetry values the column was emptied and repacked. After each experiment series the column was demagnetized with the help of a degaussing coil (Entmagnetisierer EM-60, MAGNET-PHYSIK Dr. Steingroever GmbH, Cologne, Germany) to remove potential remanence magnetization. Afterwards the column was washed until no significant change in the UV signal was perceived anymore. To clean the filters of the column and reduce the back pressure a change between up- and down-flow was applied while washing when necessary. Once a pressure of 50\,bar was reached the filters were replaced. The blocked filters were regenerated by storing them for 24 hours in oxcalic acid with a concentration of 250\,g/l on a stirrer plate at a temperature between 35 an 40$^\circ$C.

\subsubsection{Flow rate optimization}
\label{subsubsec:Flow_rate}
In a first step the flow rate was optimized for each matrix material. For this purpose flow rates of 0.1\,ml/min, 0.2\,ml/min and 0.5\,ml/min were tested. The nanoparticle suspension was injected with a volume of 100\,\textmu l and the above mentioned method (see Section\,\ref{subsec:Exp_Pro}) run with the corresponding flow rates. The resulting UV peaks were analyzed for their asymmetry and reproducibility. Also the comparability with the results from \cite{AndreMaster} was taken into consideration.  

\subsubsection{Retention of magnetic nanoparticle suspension}
\label{subsubsec:Ret_nanopart_method}
The main objective of this experiments was to assess the retention of the magnetic nanoparticles through a magnetized packed bed. The magnetization of the packed bed was achieved by the Helmholtz coil described in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:helm_coil}. The homogeneous magnetic field within the coil was created by a power amplifier connected to a function generator, which generated an alternating current with a square wave signal. The power amplifier was used to change the electric signal and thereby vary the magnetic flux density. For all experiments a flow rate of 0.5\,ml/min and magnetic flux densities between 0\,mT and 17\,mT were used. \\
The magnetic field could be influenced by the variation of the frequency, duty cycle and amplitude. A constant magnetic field was produced by setting the high and low state to the closest values possible. The smallest difference achievable with the used function generator was 4\,mV. Therefore a high level value of 400\,mV and a low level value of 396\,mV was used to approximate a direct current (see Figure\,\ref{fig:waveform}). To investigate the impact of an alternating magnetic field the low level was set to -\,400\,mV whereas the high level stayed at 400\,mV. To simulate a magnetic field being turned on and off a low level value of 0\,mV was chosen. For the matrix material \gls{pmma} all described variations were applied with the frequencies 100\,mHz and 1000\,mHz . For the matrix material SRA-150 and TruFrom only the constant and on/off fields with frequencies of 100\,mHz, 500\,mHz and 1000\,mHz were tested. The duty cycle, the ratio of the high period to the total period of the square wave, was set to 50\,\% for all experiments. An exception was an experiment with the TruForm particles were the off phase was reduced to 20\,\%.

\scalebox{0.60}{\includegraphics{figures/waveform.pdf}}

}
\end{figure}


In addition saturation experiments were conducted with the TruForm material. For those experiments the column was first washed with 1\,ml and no magnetic field, next the sample solution was injected and the constant magnetic field was turned on. The magnetic field was held till the column was washed with 2\,ml. The cycle was repeated till no further change in the UV peak could be observed. The experiment was conducted twice, once with an used and once with a new filter. A magnetic flux density of 17\,mT was used for the saturation experiments.\\
In order to evaluate the influence of the nanoparticle concentration on the retention behaviour, the Chemagen nanoparticle suspension was diluted 1:100, 1:150 and 1:200. The dilutions were tested with TruForm matrix material and a constant magnetic field. The Micromod nanoparticle suspensions were also only used for experiments with the TruForm matrix material and a constant magnetic field.\\
For further analysis the third peak of each triple determination was fractionated and collected in 1.5\,ml microreaction tubes with a volume of 1.5\,ml. A Unicorn method was written to start the fractionation as soon as an increase in the UV signal was detected. As fraction volume 200\,\textmu l was chosen. The fractionation was stopped as soon as the UV signal sank below 0.1\,mAu.

\subsection{Analytical methods}
\label{subsec:ana_met}
 For the characterization of the matrix materials and the nanoparticle suspensions several different analytical methods were used. The particle size distribution was determined either by dynamic light scattering, light microscope or under the \gls{esem} described in Sections \ref{subsubsec:part_dist_meas}, \ref{subsubsec:light_mic} and \ref{subsubsec:ESEM}. The method for the determination of the magnetic properties of several used matrix materials is described in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:Mag_char}. For characterization of the magnetic field within the Helmholtz coil a Hall effect sensor was used (see Section\,\ref{subsubsec:Hall_eff}).   
 
 
\subsubsection{Measurement of particle size distributions}
\label{subsubsec:part_dist_meas}
For the determination of the particle size distribution two different measurement devices were used. The matrix materials were analyzed with an CIS 100-S particle sizer (Ankersmid, Nijverdal, Netherlands). The measurement system combines two analytical techniques, namely laser obstruction time analysis and dynamic image analysis to analyze both the size distribution and shape factors of the sample. For the laser obstruction time measurement a helium-neon laser with a wavelength of 632,8\,nm rotates with a constant frequency and interacts with particles in the sample solution. Each scanned particle temporarily blocks the path of the laser beam to the corresponding photo diode, which registers the time of transition. The obstruction time in combination with the frequency is then related to the particle diameter \cite{neis1997particle}. Additionally dynamic image analysis is used to determine the particle shape parameters. With this combination spherical and non-spherical particles in a range between 0.1\,\textmu m to 3,600\,\textmu m can be measured. For each sample a three-fold determination was conducted, with a length of 60\,s for each measurement cycle. In addition the reproducibility of the measurement was verified by the measurement software. As sample preparation a spatula tip of the matrix material was mixed with 2\,ml of ultra-pure water. Of this suspension 1500\,\textmu l were filled into a cuvette. If necessary the sample was further diluted with ultra-pure water. During the measurement period the suspension was continuously mixed with a pipette (Eppendortf Research \textsuperscript{\textregistered} plus (blue), Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) to ensure homogeneity. \\
\\
For the determination of the particle size distributions of the magnetic nanoparticle suspensions and the collected nanoparticle fractions (see Section\,\ref{subsubsec:Ret_nanopart_method}) a Zetasizer Nano ZSP (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, England) was used. The nanoparticle stock suspensions were diluted 1:100 in ultra-pure water, while for the fractions no further dilution was necessary. The Chemagen nanoparticle solution was measured in filtered and unfiltered form (see Section\,\ref{subsec:Mag_nanoparticles}), whereas the Micromod particles were not filtered at all. For each measurement 50\,\textmu l of the sample was pipetted into a quartz cuvette and put into the Zetasizer. For all samples a triple determination was conducted. The size measurement was performed by dynamic light scattering. Particles scatter the light from a helium-neon laser with a wavelength of 633\,nm creating a fluctuation in the detected scattering intensity over time. This fluctuation is due to the Brownian motion, which leads to diffusion of particles at a speed related to their size and temperature. From the intensity changes a correlation function is generated from which the diffusion coefficient is deducted. The particle size distribution is then calculated with the Stokes-Einstein equation (see Equation\,\ref{eq:Stokes_Einstein}) \cite{berne2000dynamic}. Particle sizes could be measured in the range of 0.3\,nm to 10\,\textmu m \cite{Zetasizer}. For the evaluation only particles in the nanometer size range were considered. In order to reduce the influence of contaminations, either leaked matrix material or dust, within the samples, all particles with a size of over 1\,\textmu m were not included in the size distributions.

\subsubsection{Environmental scanning electron microscope}
\label{subsubsec:ESEM}
The particle shape, size and surface properties were characterized with an \gls{esem} (XL 30-FEG, Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands). \gls{esem} is a procedure in which uncoated samples can be examined with an electron beam. The samples to be analyzed were placed within the sample chamber. Then a vacuum was applied reaching pressures between 130\,Pa and 1300\,Pa. An electron beam is focused on the sample which leads to the ejection of secondary electrons from the sample surface. These secondary electrons are then accelerated towards the electric field of a detector. The detected signal is converted into an image of the sample. With this method it is possible to magnify the samples by a factor of 50 up to 5100 \cite{danilatos1993introduction}.     
\gls{esem} measurements were used for the characterization of the TruForm matrix material. As sample preparation a defined quantity of the matrix material was put on a sample holder. No further sample preparation was needed.

\subsubsection{Light microscope}
\label{subsubsec:light_mic}
The characterization of the \gls{pmma} matrix material was conducted with the help of a VHX-5000 digital microscope system (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). A 500 frames per second camera captures image data with different focus positions and generates high resolution images on an attached monitor. By variation of the shutter speed the resolution and contrast are further increased. In addition the optimal wavelength to generate clear images is automatically selected \cite{VHX5000}. For the measurement the matrix material was suspended in ultra-pure water. A few drops of the suspension were placed on a slide and put onto the object stage. The magnification was slowly increased until a high resolution image was acquired. By measuring the distance from two neighbouring pixels on the screen dimension measurements were possible. With this method the mean diameter of the measured matrix particles was determined.    


\subsubsection{Concentration determination of the nanoparticle suspension}
\label{subsubsec:Conc_MF}
For the determination of the Chemagen nanoparticle concentration 200\,\textmu l of the particle suspension was filled into an HPLC vial. All measurements were conducted in triple determination. Before filling the empty weight of the vials was determined with a MC5 microbalance (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). The vials were dried for 24 hours at \SI{60}{\celsius} in a drying cabinet (Drying Cabinet ULE 500, Memmert GmbH, Schwabach, Germany). The vials were allowed to cool in a desiccator for 20 minutes and then weighed again. From the difference between the current and the empty weight the mass of the magnetic nanoparticles could be calculated. With the calculated mass and the used suspension volume the concentration could be determined.  


\subsubsection{Magnetization determination of the matrix materials and nanoparticle suspension}
\label{subsubsec:Mag_char}
The characterization of the magnetic properties of the matrix materials was performed with an \gls{agm} (Micromag 2900, Princeton Measurments Corp, Princeton, USA). As sample preparation a defined amount of matrix material was given onto a strip of adhesive tape and hermetically sealed with another piece of tape. For accuracy reasons the particle mass was not larger than 5\,mg. The sample was then placed onto a cantilevered rod including a piezoelectric element, magnetized by a dc field and overlaid by an oscillating magnetic field gradient. Through the  oscillating magnetic field gradient the sample experiences an alternating force  which is proportional to the magnitude of the field gradient and the magnetic moment of the sample. This force deflects the sample rod within the magnetic field which leads to a voltage output of the piezoelectric element. With a variation of the alternating magnetic field strength the voltage signals can be converted into a magnetization curve \cite{flanders1988alternating}. The magnetization within the magnetization curve was normalized with the mass of the used sample. Before the actual measurements, the \gls{agm} was calibrated with a nickel standard. From the hysteresis loop the magnetic properties of the materials could be extracted. On all samples a threefold determination was performed.    

\subsubsection{Analysis of the magnetic flux density}
\label{subsubsec:Hall_eff}
The magnetic flux density within the Helmholtz coil was measured with a Hall effect sensor (FH 31/4, MAGNET-PHYSIK Dr. Steingroever GmbH, Cologne, Germany). The Hall effect sensor consists of a thin rectangular p-type semiconductor material on which a constant current is applied. When the sensor is placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the current the electrons are deflected towards one edge of the sensor. The result is a potential difference that develops between the upper and lower edge of the conductor which is referred to as the Hall voltage. The Hall voltage is proportional to the applied current and the magnetic flux density \cite{svoboda2004magnetic}.\\%%%%%V=-(I*B)/(e*rho*t) 
The magnetic flux density of the Helmholtz coil was measured for different currents in six different positions along the symmetry axis in the center of the Helmholtz coil. The resulting flux density was then compared to the calculated values for the Helmholtz coil (see Section\,\ref{subsubsec:helm_coil}). 


\subsection{Evaluation methods}
\label{subsec:Eval}
For the evaluation of both, the particle size distribution and the retention experiments, evaluation routines were written in Python. Wherever possible the same evaluation methods as in \cite{AndreMaster} were applied to ensure comparability. The graphical evaluation methods are describe in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:Graph_eval}, while the mathematical evaluation methods can be found in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:Math_eval}.

\subsubsection{Graphical evaluation}
\label{subsubsec:Graph_eval}
In order to compare the results from the particle size distribution measurements, the D-values D10, D50 and D90 were determined. D50 is defined as the diameter where half of the particles are smaller than this value. Likewise 10\,\% of the population lie below the value from D10 and 90\,\% below the value of D90 \cite{merkus2009particle}. The cumulative distribution is  approximated by a least squares polynomial fit, where the solution minimizes the squared error E (see Equation\,\ref{eq:polyfit_er}) for the equations shown in \ref{eq:polyfit_eq}.  

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:polyfit_er}
\centering
E = \sum_{j=0}^{k}\vert p(x_{j})-y_{j}\vert^{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:polyfit_eq}
\centering
\begin{split}
x[0]^{n}p[0] + ... + x[0]p[n-1] + p[n] = y[0] \\
x[1]^{n}p[0] + ... + x[1]p[n-1] + p[n] = y[1]  \\
... \\ 
x[k]^{n}p[0] + ... + x[k]p[n-1] + p[n] = y[k]
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $p$ represents the polynomial coefficients, $n$ the degree of the polynomial, $y$ the y-coordinates and $x$ the x-coordinates of the sample points. The coefficient matrix of the coefficient $p$ is called Vandermonde matrix \cite{bjorck1970solution}. With this fit the D-values were calculated. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Add Number distribution%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Mathematical evaluation}
\label{subsubsec:Math_eval}
For the evaluation of the retention experiments with the magnetic nanoparticle suspensions the UV signal from the \gls{fplc}-system was used. The influence of the magnetic field was determined by a comparison of the UV peak area and retention with the retention and area of a control peak with no magnetic field applied. The area of the peak (see Equation\,\ref{eq:area}) provides information about the particles bound in the packed bed at a certain magnetic field strength.    

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:area}
\centering
area = \sum_{j=1}^{N}[(x_{i+1}-x_{i})(\frac{y_{i+1}+y_{i}}{2})]
\end{equation}

The first term on the right side of Equation\,\ref{eq:area} depicts an infinitely small interval of the volume which has flown through the column in ml, while the second term describes the average of the UV signal in mAU within the limits of x. The results were normalized by dividing the area of a peak with an applied magnetic field by the area of a standard peak without the influence of magnetic field. \\

%%%%%%%%%Check this find better description%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Equations\,\ref{eq:ret_sum} and \ref{eq:ret_comp} for the calculation of the retention of the nanoparticles are shown in the following:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ret_sum}
\centering
k = k_{s} = \sum_{j=1}^{N}[(x_{i+1}-x_{i})(\frac{y_{i+1}+y_{i}}{2})(\frac{x_{i+1}+x_{i}}{2})]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ret_comp}
\centering
retention = \frac{k}{k_{s}}
\end{equation}

In order to evaluate the influence of the retention the average of volume $(x_{i+1}+x_{i})/2$ within the infinitely small interval of $x_{i+1}-x_{i}$ was added to the area. The retention $k$ of a field under magnetic influence was also normalized by the division with the retention $k_{s}$ of a standard peak.

\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\label{chap:chap_res}
After the theoretical concepts were discussed and the model and experimental setup was described this chapter gives and overview of both the simulation and the experiemntal results. The results from the model parameter studies are presented and discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:sim_res}. Furthermore the the experimental results are shown and compared with the the simulation results (see Section\,\ref{sec:exp_res}). 

\section{Simulation results}
\label{sec:sim_res}
The model of the retention of nanoparticles by magnetized cylindrical wires, described in Section\,\ref{sec:Model_setup}, was run and evaluated as described in Section\,\ref{subsec:Param_studies}. In order to validate the model, the results are compared to analytical and published simulated solutions for the magnetic field and the flow around a cylinder. In Section\,\ref{subsec:Param_res} the results from the parameter studies and their influence on the nanoparticle retention are presented and discussed.  

\subsection{Mesh refinement study}
\label{subsec:mesh_ref}
As the accuracy of \gls{fem} models is strongly dependent on the mesh size, a mesh refinement study was performed. The model was also used to perform parameter studies, therefore it was also important to limit the increase in computation time to an acceptable value, that still allowed the simulation of several model runs in a sufficiently short time period. The convergence of the tracking parameter residence time and the computation time for the individual runs of the parameter study are shown in Table\,\ref{table:Mesh_Ref_res}. The specifications for the different mesh sizes can be found in Table\,\ref{table:Mesh_Ref}. The deviation of the residence time of 1.04\,\% between the fine and the finer mesh element size lies below the beforehand specified convergence criterion of a deviation smaller than 1.5\,\%. In addition, a considerable increase of 228\,\% in computation time from 27\,s to 74\,s could be observed between those two meshes. Hence the fine mesh size was chosen for all further simulations.

\label{subsec:mod_val}

The model validation was conducted by the comparison of the simulation results with analytical and other model solutions, as well as experimental data.
The simulated magnetic field around a single wire is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:sw_mag_field}.

The colors indicate the magnetic field where maxima/minima in same direction/perpendicular to the magnetic field can be observed. A maximum value of 3.07$\cdotp$10\textsuperscript{4}\,A/m on the top and bottom and a minimum of 3.58\,A/m on both sides of the wire are detected for the magnetic field intensity. This indicates that the field is attractive on the top and bottom of the wire i.e. a positive magnetic field gradient prevails, while it is repulsive on both wire sides, i.e. a negative field gradient develops. These attractive and repulsive magnetic forces are visualized in Figure\,\ref{fig:mag_force_sw}, where the color indicates the magnitude of the magnetic field gradient in the y-direction and the arrows indicate the direction and magnitude of the magnetic force $F_{m}$. The magnetic field intensity around a circular wire simulated by Lindner et al. \cite{lindner2013simulation} exhibits very similar positions for the minima and maxima of the magnetic field strength in regard to the field direction and also a very similar overall distribution of the magnetic field intensity (see Figure\,\ref{fig:mag_field_nirschl}). The magnetic field lines depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:sw_mag_field} also match with the experimental visualization of the magnetic field lines in Figure\,\ref{fig:mag_field_hale}. The magnetic field lines exhibit a very similar pattern in both cases, as in the two-dimensional case no distinction between wire and sphere can be made. The field lines are denser in the close vicinity of the wire reflecting the high magnetic field strength, while the field lines become less dense with the diminishing field strength at a distance from the wire. As the simulation is in good accordance with both the experimental data shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:mag_field_hale} as well as the parallel simulation shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:mag_field_nirschl}, the model was deemed adequate for the simulation of the magnetic field.

Figure\,\ref{fig:creep_flow_sw} shows the simulated streamlines around a single wire for an inlet velocity of 20\,mm/s with no-slip boundary conditions at the wires surface and constant velocity at the channel walls. The image depicts the typical streamlines, that also develop in flow experiments (see Figure\,\ref{fig:creep_1}) past a circular cylinder for low Reynolds numbers.  A streamline is a path traced out by a massless particle as it moves with the flow. It can be seen that the steady-state flow is completely symmetrical to both the y- and the x-axis. At a distance of 150\,\textmu m from the wire the flow is unidirectional and uniform. On both sides of the wire the flow speed increases in consistence with the Bernoulli equation, which leads to a lower pressure in those regions. The vertical streamlines at the wires surface center clearly suggest the stagnation point where the velocity is zero and the pressure reaches a maximum at the front center of the cylinder \cite{oertel2001introduction}. Overall the simulated flow around a cylinder with low Reynolds numbers exhibits the same characteristics as the experimentally observed flow (see Figure\, \ref{fig:creep_1}).

\subsection{Parameter studies}
\label{subsec:Param_res}

Parameter studies were performed to get a better understanding of the influence of the different variables, i.e. the magnetic flux density $B_{0}$, the initial flow velocity $U_{0}$, the nanoparticle size $R_{p}$ and the wire radius $R_{w}$, on the retention behaviour of the nanoparticles.
Most parameter runs were performed with a wire radius of 30\,\textmu m, which fits the volumetric median diameter D50 of 31,25\,\textmu m of the TruForm matrix material used for the retention experiments (see Section\,\ref{subsec:mat_mag_char_res}). In addition to the single wire setup, the parameter studies were performed with two and four wire configurations. The resulting magnetic field and flux around the single wire were already described in Section\,\ref{subsec:mod_val}. In the following, a short overview of the resulting  magnetic fields and fluxes around the two and four cylinder setup is given.\\
In Figure\,\ref{fig:tw_fw_mag_field} the simulated magnetic field intensity and the magnetic field lines for two and four cylindrical wires are shown. It is apparent that the minimum and maximum values of the magnetic field intensity can still be located in the same positions on each wire as for a single wire (see Section\,\ref{subsec:mod_val}). The highest values for the field strength, however, decrease from 3.07$\cdotp$10\textsuperscript{-4}\,A/m for the single wire configuration to 2.82$\cdotp$10\textsuperscript{-4}\,A/m and 2.04$\cdotp$10\textsuperscript{-4}\,A/m for the two and four wire setup respectively. As there are more surfaces for the particles to be attracted to than in the single wire setup and the particles can not as easily bypass the wire without being influenced by the magnetic field gradient the retention is assumed to increase with a higher number of wires.\\
For all three setups the particles deposit preferentially on the upstream part of the wires, in the regions of high attracting magnetic field gradients \textbf{discussion?}. Exemplary images of the particle distribution around the wires for different magnetic field strengths can be found in the Appendix (Figures \textbf{add Figures from Appendix}).

  \end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:tw_fw_flow_field} the fluid flow around the two and four wire configuration for $U_{0}$=20\,mm/s is shown. The no-slip boundary condition on the wire surface leads to a velocity of zero directly at the surface and a forming of a boundary layer in the vicinity. As the cross section between the cylinders is decreased the velocity of the fluid is increased in accordance with Bernoulli's principle. For two cylinders a maximum velocity of 443\,\textmu m/s and for four cylinders of 1640\,\textmu m/s is reached in between the wires, while a maximum velocity of only 310\,\textmu m/s can be observed in the one wire setup. This result in a higher drag force on particles in the high velocity regions, which should lead to the partciles beeing pulled by the wire without retention.

\subsubsection{Single wire parameter study results}
\label{subsubsec:One_wire}

The single wire study was run with two different boundary conditions at the channel walls, namely a Dirichlet condition of a fixed flow velocity and a periodic boundary condition (see Section \ref{subsec:model_eq_BC}). The periodic boundary condition was chosen in order to simulate the conditions in a packed bed with more than just one wire more closely. To evaluate the influence of the different parameters on the nanoparticles, the normalized mean retention (see Equation\,\ref{eq:residence_time}) of the particles within the circular domain around the wire and at the channel outflow  was determined for each run. At the channel outflow no significant retention of the particles could be observed. This is most likely due to the vast amount of particles passing by the single wire without getting close enough to the wire to be influenced by the magnetic force. For the constant speed boundary condition at the channel walls the nanoparticles are also dragged along the wall towards the channel outflow without the effect of different accelerating forces. Therefore, only the retention within the circular domain around the wire is evaluated below. The retention was calculated by the division of the measured residence time by the residence time for 0\,mT at the same conditions. Therefore for a retention of 1, the residence time of the run is equal to the residence time at 0\,mT and consequently no retaining effect can observed on the particles. Retention values of larger than 1 implicate, that the residence time for the run is larger than the residence time of the particles at 0\,mT, while retention value smaller than 1 indicate, that the residence time is smaller, i.e. the particles were faster, than the corresponding residence time at 0\,mT. The simulations were conducted for the all magnetic field intensities from 0 to 35\,mT with $R_{w}$=25\,textmu m, $U_{0}$=200\,\textmu m/s and $R_{p}$=30\,nm. The respective variable parameter was only varied at 0, 12.5, 22.5 and 32.5\,mT due to lack of time. For missing data point the simulation did not converge due to various reasons.

        \label{fig:sw_param_res_constBC}
  \end{figure}
  
The results of the parameter runs for the Dirichlet boundary condition are depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:sw_param_res_constBC}. The determined retention is plotted against the externally applied magnetic flux density $B_{0}$. The different varied parameter values are indicated by the colorbar. In Figure\, \ref{subfig:sw_constBC_Rw_var} the wire radius $R_{w}$ was varied from 5 to 45\,\textmu m. Between 0 and 20\,mT only a slight increase of the retention from 1 to 1.08 can be observed for all values of $R_{w}$. Above 22.5\,mT the retention increases dramatically and reaches a maximum calculable retention of 2.39 at 35\,mT for $R_{w}$ at 25\,\textmu m. This increase was expected as the magnetic force $F_{m}$    
affecting the magnetic nanoparticles also increases with an increase in $B_{0}$. For magnetic fields higher than 35\,mT, the simulation did not converge as the magnetic force was so strong as to draw particles from outside of the calculation domain. An increase of $R_{w}$ should result in lower residence times due to the decreased magnetic field gradient. This can however not be clearly observed in this study. Unfortunately, for higher values of $R_{w}$ the whole system also became unstable and did not converge. Therefore, this hypothesis could not be confirmed for the used setup. The inlet velocity $U_{0}$ was varied between the values of 50 and 300\,\textmu m/s (see Figure\,\ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_U0_var}). An almost exponential increase of the retention with increasing values of $B_{0}$ can be observed. It can be seen that contrary to expectations a lower value of $U_{0}$ leads to a lower retention of the particles. At 32.5\,mT a 40\,\% \textbf{values?} difference in the retention time can be observed between 100 and 300\,\textmu m/s, which is most likely due to the different flow conditions for different flow velocities. In Figure\,\ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_Rp_var} the results from the variation of the particle radius $R_{p}$ in a range of 20 to 100\,nm are depicted. Again an increase in the retention with increasing $B_{0}$ values comparable to Figure\,\ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_Rw_var} can be seen. The magnetic force is directly proportional to the cube of the particle radius and increases significantly with the particle size (see Equation \ref{eq:force_rad}), therefore larger particles were assumed to be more strongly retained than smaller particles. This effect is reinforced by the diffusion force whose influence increases with decreasing particle size (see Section\,\ref{subsec:bas_princ}). The results depicted in Figure \ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_Rw_var} confirm this hypothesis. The larger the particle radius the higher the resulting retention. At 12.5\,mT with a retention value close to 1 no retention for particles with an $R_{p}$ of 30\,nm or smaller can be observed, while particles with 40 and 50\,nm show retention values of 1.12 and 1.15 respectively. For particles with even larger $R_{p}$ values the retention increases further to 1.86 and 2.4 for 75 an 100\,nm respectively. This indicates that a size separation of the particles through different retention times is already possible with low magnetic field strengths. For higher magnetic field strengths at e.g. 22.5\,mT the same effect can be observed. Here, however, the runs with the largest particle radii of 75 and 100\,nm do not converge as the magnetic force is already too strong and pulls particles from the outside of the domain. This suggests that increasing the magnetic field intensity indefinitely may not necessarily improve the separation performance in practical use \cite{ge2017magnetic}.Therefore it can be concluded that the magnetic field strength has to be adapted individually to the particles that should to be separated.\\ 

\FloatBarrier
In order to achieve a more realistic model setup periodic boundary conditions were applied to the channel walls. The results from the parameter runs with the periodic boundaries are depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:sw_param_res_periodicBC}. As in Figure\,\ref{fig:sw_param_res_constBC} a general increase of the retention with an increasing magnetic field strength can be observed. The results from the periodic boundary condition setup, however, exhibit a much more continuous slope, while the constant velocity boundary setup shows a sharp rise of retention at 22.5\,mT. This could be due to the constant fluid velocity at the channel walls, which drags the particles quickly past the wire. Only for higher values of $B_{0}$, $F_{m}$ becomes large enough to divert the particles towards the wire. In Figure \ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_Rw_var} the retention for different values of $R_{w}$ are depicted. A decrease in the size of the wire increases the magnetic field gradient without changing the relative distribution of the magnetic field. This leads to higher values of $F_{m}$ and consequently higher retention for lower values of $R_{w}$. The higher $B_{0}$ the better this effect can be seen. At 32.5\,mT the retention is increased by a factor of 2 from the largest wire with $R_{w}$=35\,\textmu m to the smallest $R_{w}$=5\,\textmu m. This effect was already described by \cite{aharoni1976traction}. For lower values of $B_{0}$ between 0 and 20\,mT no such effect can be observed, as the differences in the produced magnetic field gradients are still too low to induce a significant difference in the retention time. Nevertheless, matrix material with a small particle size between 5 and 20\,\textmu m should be chosen for experimental applications to maximize the magnetic force acting on the nanoparticles. \cite{oberteuffer1974magnetic} demonstrated that the capture efficiency for a wire is greatest if the radius of the wire is equal to or smaller than three times the particle radius. Therefore for selective separation the size of the matrix material needs to be compatible with the size distribution of the particles, which should be separated \cite{ge2017magnetic}. \newline
In Figure \ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_U0_var} the resulting retention for different values of  $U_{0}$ is shown. Again a higher retention for higher flow velocities can be observed, which was also detected in Figure \,\ref{subfig:sw_constBC_U0_var}. At 32.5\,mT a 62\,\% increase of the retention from 150\,\textmu m/s to 400\,\textmu m/s can be observed. Higher flow velocities might lead to more turbulence near the wire, which in turn might lead to the particles being transported closer to the wires surface by the fluid flow. The influence of $R_{p}$ on the particle retention is shown in Figure\,\ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_Rp_var}. The trend, which can already be seen in Figure\,\ref{subfig:sw_constBC_Rp_var} for the constant velocity boundary condition, that the retention is increased for increasing particle sizes is confirmed by the results from the periodic boundary condition setup. Already at a low magnetic flux density of 5\,mT the 100\,nm particles are slightly retained with a retention value of 1.1, while the nanoparticles equal or smaller than 50\,nm do not show any significant retention. For higher values of $B_{0}$, the differences of retention between the different particle sizes increase considerably. At 12.5\,mT particles with a diameter of 20 and 30\,nm are not yet retained at all, while for particles with $R_{p}$ of 40 and 50\,nm a retention of 1.12 and 1.21 respectively is observed. The retention for even larger particles with 75\,nm lies at 1.98 and for 100\,nm at 2.39. For higher values of $B_{0}$ the lager particles start to accumulate on the wires surface and are thus removed from the fluid flow. As this effect is not desirable within the separation column, the magnetic field strength has to be chosen carefully according to the size of the particles to be separated.

Overall it can be seen that all four tested parameters ($B_{0}$, $R_{w}$, $U_{0}$ and $R_{p}$) exhibit a significant influence on the retention behaviour of the magnetic nanoparticles in the single wire setup. Higher magnetic flux densities lead independently from the other three parameters to higher retention times. A smaller wire radius is desirable to achieve higher retention as well as faster inlet velocities. It could also be demonstrated that a size separation of the nanoparticles at magnetic fields for 12.5\,mT and higher values is possible. The separation efficiency on the wire can be controlled by specifying a combination of the magnetic field, fluid flow velocity and wire radius. However, in experimental applications, the magnetic matrix contains many matrix elements and the study of a single wire does not reflect the real situation in the separation column. Therefore more parameter runs with a group of matrix elements (two and four wires) were conducted (see Section\,\ref{subsubsec:Two_wires}).

\subsubsection{Two and four wire parameter study results}
\label{subsubsec:Two_wires}
In order to examine a setup closer to the real matrix configurations within a column, parameter models for a two and four wires were established. The magnetic field distribution and the flow conditions for the two configurations are shown in Section\,\ref{subsec:Param_res}. In Section \ref{subsubsec:One_wire} it could be seen, that the periodic boundary condition on the channel walls is a more realistic  representation of the conditions in a separation column. Consequently, only the results from those parameter studies are presented and discussed below. Plots of the parameter study results with constant velocity boundary conditions at the channel walls can be found in the Appendix (see Figures\,\ref{fig:tw_param_res_constBC} and \ref{fig:fw_param_res_constBC}). For both, the two and four wire setup, the three parameters $B_{0}$, $U_{0}$ and $R_{p}$ were varied, while in contrast to the single wire setup $R_{w}$ was held constant at 25\,\textmu m.

In Figure\,\ref{fig:tw_param_res_periodicBC} the resulting retention values for the two wire setup and in Figure \,\ref{fig:fw_param_res_periodicBC} the values results from the four wire configuration are plotted against $B_{0}$. Again a continuous increase of the retention with increasing $B_{0}$ is depicted in all four plots. In Figure \ref{subfig:tw_periodicBC_U0_var} and \ref{subfig:fw_periodicBC_U0_var} an almost exponential increase can be observed for the retention. In the two wire setup $U_{0}$ exhibits the same influence on the particle retention as for the single wire setup, where a higher flow velocity leads to higher retention times. This effect, however, is only significant at high magnetic fields of 32.5\,mT and above. The maximum retention at 32.5\,mT and 300\,\textmu m/s is, however, around 25\,\% lower than the maximum retention reached in the single wire. The same applies for the maximum retention for 200\,\textmu m/s which is with a retention value of 1.96 still lower than 2.19 from the single wire configuration. These differences can be explained by the much higher velocity of 443\,\textmu m/s, as compared to 310\,\textmu m/ for the single wire setup, reached in the cross section between the wires (see Figure \ref{fig:tw_fw_flow_field}). For the four wire setup the retention reached at 32.5\,mT and and 300\,\textmu m/s is even lower with 1.26. With a maximum velocity of 1640\,\textmu m/s the four wire setup, however, exhibits by far the highest flow speeds in between the wires. Due to the high flow velocities, no clear dependency of the retention on $U_{0}$ could be detected. Unfortunately, for slower inlet velocities than the applied 50\,\textmu m/s the system did not converge, therefore no further investigation of the dependency of the retention on $U_{0}$ could be performed. \newline
In Figures\,\ref{subfig:tw_periodicBC_Rp_var} and \ref{subfig:fw_periodicBC_Rp_var} the retention is depicted for different values of $R_{p}$. It is noticeable, that a much slower increase of the retention with increasing values of $B_{0}$ occurs as compared to the single wire setup. While the retention for the single wire setup at 20\,mT and an $R_{p}$ of 30\,nm is already at a value of 1.2, the two and four wire setup exhibit with values of 1.08 and 1.05 respectively no significant increase. The same can be observed at 32,5\,mT for 30\,nm particles were the maximum retention declines from a value of 2.19 for the single wire to 1.96 for the two wire and 1.31 for the four wire configuration. The same dependency of the retention on the size as already described in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:One_wire} can be seen in both the two and the four wire results, e.g. in the four wire setup at 12.5\,mT particles with an $R_{p}$ of 100 and 75\,nm show a retention of 2.4 and 1.26 respectively, while all smaller particles are not significantly retained. This indicates that a size separation by the retention in a column with far more than just 4 matrix elements should also be possible at low magnetic field strengths. However, even the configuration of a group of matrix elements does not reflect the complexity of the packed bed within the separation column. Therefore only tendencies for the retention behaviour of nanoparticles within a magnetized packed bed can be extracted from the models.

In this Section the dependency of the retention of nanoparticles on different parameters, namely $B_{0}$, $R_{w}$, $U_{0}$ and $R_{p}$ , was investigated. A strong dependency on $B_{0}$ and $R_{w}$ could be detected. In addition, the existence of a size separation effect of the nanoparticles through different retention times was demonstrated. The findings about the influence of $R_{p}$ and $R_{w}$ as well as of the strength of $B_{0}$ on the retention will be compared to the experimental results in Section\,\ref{sec:exp_res}.


% 
% \subsection{Parameter studies}
% \label{subsec:Param_res}
% 
% Parameter studies were performed to get a better understanding of the influence of the different parameters, i.e. the magnetic flux density $B_{0}$, the initial flow velocity $U_{0}$, the nanoparticle size $R_{p}$ and the wire radius $R_{w}$, on the retention behaviour of the nanoparticles.
% Most parameter runs were performed with a particle radius of 30\,\textmu m, which fits the volumetric median diameter D50 of 31,25\,\textmu m of the TruForm matrix material used for the retention experiments (see Section\,\ref{subsec:mat_mag_char_res}). In addition to the single wire setup the parameter studies were performed with two and four wire configurations. The resulting magnetic field and flux around the single wire were already described in Section\,\ref{subsec:mod_val}. In the following a short overview of the resulting magnetic fields and fluxes around the two and four cylinder setup is given. \\
% In Figure\,\ref{fig:tw_fw_mag_field} the simulated magnetic field intensity and the magnetic field lines for two and four magnetized cylindrical wires are shown. It is apparent that the minimum and maximum values of the magnetic field intensity can still be located in the same positions as for a single wire. The highest values for the field strength however decrease from 3.07$\cdotp$10\textsuperscript{-4}\,A/m for the single wire configuration to 2.82$\cdotp$10\textsuperscript{-4}\,A/m and 2.04$\cdotp$10\textsuperscript{-4}\,A/m for the two and four wire setup respectively. As there are more surfaces for the particles to be attracted to than in the single wire setup and the particles can not as easily bypass the wire without being influenced by the magnetic field gradient the retention is assumed to increase with an increase in the number of wires.\\
% For all three setups the particles deposit preferentially on the upstream part of the wires, in the regions of high attracting magnetic field gradients. Exemplary images of the particle distribution around the wires for different magnetic field strengths can be found in the Appendix (Figures \textbf{add Figures from Appendix}).

% In Figure \ref{fig:tw_fw_flow_field} the fluid flow around the two and four wire configuration for $U_{0}$=20mm/s is shown. The no-slip boundary condition on the wire surface leads to a velocity of zero directly at the surface and a forming of a boundary layer in the vicinity. As the cross section between the cylinders is decreased the velocity of the fluid is increased in accordance with Bernoulli's principle. For two cylinders a maximum velocity of 443\,\textmu m/s and for four cylinders of 1640\,\textmu m/s is reached in between the wires, while only a maximum velocity of 310\,\textmu m/s can be observed in the one wire setup. This results in a higher drag force on particles in the high velocity regions.

% \subsubsection{Single wire paramter study results}
% \label{subsubsec:One_wire}
% 
% The single wire study was run with two different boundary conditions at the channel walls, namely a Dirichlet condition of a fixed flow velocity and a periodic boundary condition (see Section \ref{subsec:model_eq_BC}). The periodic boundary condition was chosen in order to simulate the conditions in a packed bed with more than just one wire more closely. To evaluate the influence of the different parameters on the nanoparticles the mean retention of the particles within the circular domain around the wire and at the channel outflow  was determined for each run. At the channel outflow no significant retention of the particles could be observed (not shown). This is most likely due to the vast amount of particles passing by the single wire without getting close enough to the wire to be influenced by the magnetic force. For the constant speed boundary condition at the channel walls the nanoparticles are also dragged along the wall towards the channel outflow without the effect of different accelerating force. Therefore only the retention within the circular domain around the wire is evaluated below.

% The results of the parameter runs for the Dirichlet boundary condition are depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:sw_param_res_constBC}. The determined retention is plotted against the externally applied magnetic flux density $B_{0}$. The different varied parameter values are indicated by the colorbar. In Figure\, \ref{subfig:sw_constBC_Rw_var} the wire radius $R_{w}$ was varied from 5 to 45\,\textmu m. Between 0 and 20\,mT only a slight increase of the retention from 1 to 1.08 can be observed for all values of $R_{w}$. Above 22.5\,mT the retention increases dramatically and reaches a maximum retention of 2.39 at 35\,mT for $R_{w}$ at 25\,\textmu m. This increase was expected as the magnetic force $F_{m}$    
% affecting the magnetic nanoparticles also increases with an increase in $B_{0}$. For magnetic fields higher than 35\,mT the simulation did not converge as the magnetic force was so strong as to draw particles from outside of the calculation domain. An increase of $R_{w}$ should result in lower residence times due to the decreased magnetic field gradient. This can however not be clearly observed in this study. Unfortunately for higher values of $R_{w}$ the whole system also became unstable and did not converge. Therefore this hypothesis could not be confirmed for the used setup. The inlet velocity $U_{0}$ was varied between the values of 50 and 300\,\textmu m/s (see Figure\,\ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_U0_var}). An almost exponential increase of the retention with increasing values of $B_{0}$ can be observed. It can be seen that contrary to expectations a lower value of $U_{0}$ leads to a lower retention of the particles. At 32.5\,mT a 40\,\% difference in the retention time can be observed between 100 and 300\,\textmu m/s \textbf{(why?)}. In Figure\,\ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_Rp_var} the results from the variation of the particle radius $R_{p}$ in a range of 20 to 100\,nm are depicted. Again an increase in the retention with increasing $B_{0}$ values comparable to Figure\,\ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_Rw_var} can be seen. The magnetic force is directly proportional to the cube of the particle radius and increases significantly with the particle size (see Equation \ref{eq:force_rad}), therefore larger particles were assumed to be more strongly retained than smaller particles. This effect is reinforced by the diffusion force whose influence increases with decreasing particle size (see Section\,\ref{subsec:bas_princ}). The results depicted in Figure \ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_Rw_var} confirm this hypothesis. The larger the particle radius the higher the resulting retention. At 12.5\,mT no retention for particles with an $R_{p}$ of 30\,nm or smaller can be observed, while particles with 40 and 50\,nm show retention values of 1.12 and 1.15 respectively. For particles with even larger $R_{p}$ values the retention increases further to 1.86 and 2.4 for 75 an 100\,nm respectively. This indicates that a size separation of the particles through different retention times is already possible with low magnetic field strengths. For higher magnetic field strenghts at e.g. 22.5\,mT the same effect can be observed. Here however the runs with the largest particle radii of 75 and 100\,nm do not converge as the magnetic force is already to strong. This suggests that increasing the magnetic field intensity blindly may not necessarily improve the separation performance in practical use \cite{ge2017magnetic}.Therefore it can be concluded that the magnetic field strength has to be adapted individually to the particles that should to be separated.\\ \newline
% \FloatBarrier
% In order to achieve a more realistic model setup periodic boundary conditions were applied to the channel walls. The results from the parameter runs with the periodic boundaries are depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:sw_param_res_periodicBC}. As in Figure\,\ref{fig:sw_param_res_constBC} a general increase of the retention with an increasing magnetic field strength can be observed. The results from the periodic boundary condition setup, however, exhibit a much more continuous slope, while the constant velocity boundary setup show a sharp rise of retention at 22.5\,mT. This could be due to the constant fluid velocity at the channel walls, which drags the particles quickly past the wire. Only for higher values of $B_{0}$ $F_{m}$ becomes large enough to divert the particles towards the wire. In Figure \ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_Rw_var} the retention for different values of $R_{w}$ depicted. A decrease in the size of the wire increases the magnetic field gradient without changing the relative distribution of the magnetic field (not shown). This leads to higher values of $F_{m}$ and consequently higher retention for lower values of $R_{w}$. The higher $B_{0}$ the better this effect can be seen. At 32.5\,mT the retention is increased by a factor of 2 from the largest wire with $R_{p}$=35\,\textmu m to the smallest $R_{p}$=5\,\textmu m. This effect was already described by \cite{aharoni1976traction}. For lower values of $B_{0}$ between 0 and 20\,mT no such effect can be observed, as the differences in the produced magnetic field gradients are still to low to induce a significant difference in the retention time. Nevertheless, matrix material with a small particle size between 5 and 20\,\textmu m should be chosen for experimental applications to maximize the magnetic force acting on the nanoparticles. \cite{oberteuffer1974magnetic} demonstrated that the capture efficiency for a wire is greatest if the radius of the wire is equal to or smaler than three times the particle radius. Therefore for selective separation the size of the matrix material needs to be compatible with the size distribution of the particles, which should be separated \cite{ge2017magnetic}. \newline
% In Figure \ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_U0_var} the resulting retention for different values of  $U_{0}$ is shown. Again a higher retention for higher flow velocities can be observed, which was also detected in Figure \,\ref{subfig:sw_constBC_U0_var}. At 32.5\,mT a 62\,\% increase of the retention from 150\,\textmu m/s to 400\,\textmu m/s can be observed. Higher flow velocities might lead to more turbulence near the wire, which in turn might lead to the particles being transported closer to the wires surface by the fluid flow. The influence of $R_{p}$ on the particle retention is shown in Figure\,\ref{subfig:sw_periodicBC_Rp_var}. The trend, which can already be seen in Figure\,\ref{subfig:sw_constBC_Rp_var} for the constant velocity boundary condition, that the retention is increased for increasing particle sizes is confirmed by the results from the periodic boundary condition setup. Already at a low magnetic flux density of 5\,mT the 100\,nm particles are slightly retained with 1.1, while the nanoparticles equal or smaller than 50\,nm do not show any significant retention. For higher values of $B_{0}$ the differences of retention between the different particles sizes increase considerably. At 12.5\,mT the particles with 20 and 30\,nm are not yet retained at all, while for particles with $R_{p}$ of 40 and 50\,nm a retention of 1.12 and 1.21 respectively is observed. The retention for even larger particles with 75\,nm lies at 1.98 and for 100\,nm at 2.39. For higher values of $B_{0}$ the lager particles start to accumulate on the wires surface and are thus removed form the fluid flow. As this effect is not desirable within the separation column, the magnetic field strength has to be chosen carefully according to the size of the particles to be separated. \newline \\

% Overall it can be seen that all four tested parameters ($B_{0}$, $R_{w}$, $U_{0}$ and $R_{p}$) exhibit a significant influence on the retention behaviour of the magnetic nanoparticles in the single wire setup. Higher magnetic flux densities lead independently from the other three paramteres to higher retention times. A smaller wire radius is desirable to achieve higher retention as well as faster inlet velocities. It could also be demonstrated that a size separation of the nanoparticles at magnetic fields from 12.5\,mT is possible. The separation efficiency on the wire can be controlled by specifying a combination of the magnetic field, fluid flow velocity and wire radius. However, in experimental applications, the magnetic matrix contains many matrix elements and the study of a single wire does not reflect the real situation in the separation column. Therefore more parameter runs with a group of matrix elements (two and four wires) were conducted (see Section\,\ref{subsubsec:Two_wires}).

% \subsubsection{Two and four wire paramter study results}
% \label{subsubsec:Two_wires}
% In order to examine a setup closer to the real matrix configurations within a column paramter models for a two and four wires were established. The magnetic field distribution and the flow conditions for the two configurations can be seen   
% In Section \ref{subsubsec:One_wire} it could be seen, that the periodic boundary condition on the channel walls is a more realistic  representation of the conditions in a separation column. Consequently, only the results from those parameter studies are presented and discussed below. Plots of the parameter study results with constant velocity boundary conditions at the channel walls can be found in the Appendix (see Figures\,\ref{fig:tw_param_res_constBC} and \ref{fig:fw_param_res_constBC}). For both, the two and four wire setup, the three parameters $B_{0}$, $U_{0}$ and $R_{p}$ were varied, while in contrast to the single wire setup $R_{w}$ was held constant at 25\,\textmu m.

% In Figure\,\ref{fig:tw_param_res_periodicBC} the resulting retention values for the two wire setup and in Figure \,\ref{fig:fw_param_res_periodicBC} the values results from the four wire configuration are plotted against $B_{0}$. Again an continuous increase with increasing $B_{0}$ is depicted in all four plots. In Figure \ref{subfig:tw_periodicBC_U0_var} and \ref{subfig:fw_periodicBC_U0_var} an almost exponential increase can be observed for the retention. In the two wire setup $U_{0}$ exhibits the same influence on the particle retention as for the single wire setup, where a higher flow velocity leads to higher retention times. This effect however is only significant at high magnetic fields of 32.5\,mT and above. The maximum retention at 32.5\,mT and 300\,\textmu m/s is, however, around 25\,\% lower than the maximum retention reached in the single wire. The same applies for the maximum retention for 200\,\textmu m/s which is with 1.96 still lower than the 2.19 from the single wire configuration. These differences can be explained by the much higher velocities, 443\,\textmu m/s as compared to 310\,\textmu m/ for the single wire setup, reached in the cross section between the wires (see Figure \ref{fig:tw_fw_flow_field}). For the four wire setup the retention reached at 32.5\,mT and and 300\,\textmu m/s is even lower with 1.26. With a maximum velocity of 1640\,\textmu m/s the four wire setup,however , exhibits by far the highest flow speeds in between the wires. Due to the high flow velocities no clear dependency of the retention on $U_{0}$ could be detected. Unfortunately for slower inlet velocities than the applied 50\,\textmu m/s the the system did not converge, therefore no further investigation of the dependency of the retention on $U_{0}$ could be performed. \newline
% In Figures\,\ref{subfig:tw_periodicBC_Rp_var} and \ref{subfig:fw_periodicBC_Rp_var} the retention is depicted for different values of $R_{p}$. It is noticeable, that a much slower increase of the retention with increasing values of $B_{0}$ occurs as compared to the single wire setup. While the retention for the single wire setup at 20\,mT and an $R_{p}$ of 30\,nm is already at 1.2, the two and four wire setup exhibit with 1.08 and 1.05 respectively no significant increase. The same can be observed at 32,5\,mT for 30\,nm particles were the maximum retention declines from 2.19 for the single wire  
% to 1.96 for the two wire and 1.31 for the four wire configuration. The same dependency of the retention on the size as already described in Section \ref{subsubsec:One_wire} can be seen in both the two and the four wire results, e.g. in four wire setup the at 12.5\,mT particles with an $R_{p}$ of 100 and 75\,nm show a retention of 2.4 and 1.26 respectively, while all smaller particles are not significantly retained. This suggests that a size separation through the retention in a column with far more than just 4 matrix elements should be possible even at low magnetic field strengths. However, even the configuration of a group of matrix elements does not reflect the complexity of the packed bed within the separation column. Therefore only tendencies for the retention behaviour of nanoparticles within a magnetized packed bed can be extracted from the models.

% In this Section the dependency of the retention of nanoparticles on different parameters, namely $B_{0}$, $R_{w}$, $U_{0}$ and $R_{p}$ , was investigated. A strong dependency on $B_{0}$ and $R_{w}$ could be detected. In addition the existence of a size separation effect of the nanoparticles through different retention times was demonstrated. The findings about the influence of $R_{p}$ and $R_{w}$ as well as on the strength of $B_{0}$ will be compared to the experimental results in Section\,\ref{sec:exp_res}.

\section{Experimental results}
\label{sec:exp_res}
In this section the experimental results are presented and discussed. First, the results from the matrix material and nanoparticle characterization and selection are detailed in Section\,\ref{subsec:mat_mag_char_res}. In Section\,\ref{subsec:flow_rate_res} the flow rate optimization for the separation column is described. Lastly, the retention and separation experiments with the two different matrix materials \gls{pmma} and TruForm are illustrated and discussed in Section\,\ref{subsec:pmma_res} and \ref{subsec:trufrom_res}, respectively.  

\subsection{Matrix material and magnetic nanoparticle characterization}
\label{subsec:mat_mag_char_res}
%PGV, ESEM, Microscope of PMMA, LSM, TruForm, cheamgen, Micromod
%magnetic properties(hysteresis loop)

As the material properties, e.g. size, shape and magnetization behaviour, of both the matrix material and the magnetic nanoparticles have a significant influence on the retention behaviour and the separation efficiency the used materials were thoroughly tested and characterized. 

The volume based particle size distributions for the examined matrix materials are shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:Hist_mat}. The corresponding D-values, which are characteristic of the mean size and the width of the particle size distribution and were derived from a fit of the cumulative distribution Q$_{3}$, can be found in Table\,\ref{table:D_values_matrix}. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption[Volumetric D-values for the matrix material]{Volumetric D-values for the matrix material}
\label{table:D_values_matrix}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XXXX}\hline
material specification & D10  & D50 & D90  \\
\hline\hline
TruForm & 16.38\,\textmu m & 31.25\,\textmu m & 47.01\,\textmu m \\
LSM & 24.7\,\textmu m & 46.11\,\textmu m & 81.05\,\textmu m \\
SRA-150 & 8.5\,\textmu m & 18.46\,\textmu m & 34.22\,\textmu m \\
SRA-150 sieved & 8.65\,\textmu m & 18.01\,\textmu m & 32.44\,\textmu m \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{table} 

It can be seen that the LSM matrix material with a D10 value of 24.7\,\textmu m and a D90 value of 81.05\,\textmu m exhibits a much wider particle size distribution than the two other matrix materials SRA-150 and Truform with D10 values of  8.5\,\textmu m and 16.38\,\textmu m and D90 values of 34.22\,\textmu m and 47.01\,\textmu m respectively. It is desirable to have a relatively homogeneous matrix material, at best varying no more than 10\,\% from the average particle size, in order to achieve a homogeneous packed bed, which in turn leads to uniform fluid flow characteristics within the column \cite{miltenyi1997magnetic}. In addition, smaller particles produce higher magnetic field gradients and are therefore more suitable for the separation of weakly magnetic materials. This could also be seen in the dependency of the retention on the wire radius $R_{w}$ for the single wire model in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:One_wire}. Consequently, the LSM particles were not further investigated, because the remaining matrix materials SRA-150 and TruForm exhibit narrower particle size distributions. With an average particle size of 20.0\,\textmu m and  31.72\,\textmu m and corresponding standard deviations of 11.76\,\textmu m and 9.67\,\textmu m respectively, they vary, however, further than the above mentioned 10\,\% from the average particle size. The D-values of the TruForm particles show only very slight deviations between 2 to 5\,\% from the manufacturers specifications. In order to decrease the width of the particle size distribution the SRA-150 particles, which were already used in preceding experiments by \cite{AndreMaster}, were sieved as described in Section\,\ref{subsec:Matrix_mat}. The resulting particle distribution is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:hist_SRA_sieve}. With an increase of the D10 value by 1.8\,\% and a decrease of the D50 and D90 value by 2.5\,\% and 5.5\,\%  respectively the width of the particle size distribution could not be reduced significantly. This lack of size separation may be due to the dry sieving process applied. For particles smaller than approximately 30\,\textmu m a wet sieving process reduces blocking of the sieve meshes and therefore increase the separation efficiency \cite{RetschSieve}. Nevertheless both the SRA-150 and the TruFrom matrix material were further investigated.

In addition to the particle size distribution, the particle shape of the remaining matrix materials was analyzed with the help of \gls{esem} images. It can be seen in \cite{AndreMaster}, that the SRA-150 matrix material consists of particles with partly large deviations from the ideal spherical shape. For the TruForm material (shown in Figure \ref{fig:esem_prax}) more spherical particles with a much lower percentage of deviating particle shapes can be observed. In addition to a homogeneous size of the matrix particles, a spherical shape is required to achieve a uniform spacing between the particles in the separation column \cite{miltenyi1997magnetic}. Uniform magnetic field gradients are generated within the gaps between the spheres and a substantially uniform fluid flow is produced. This configuration is desirable in order to produce a steady and reproducible separation and retention of the nanoparticles. Therefore the TruForm matrix material was chosen for the separation experiments.

  \end{figure}

In order to verify the suitability of the TruForm material for the use as separation matrix, the magnetic properties of the particles were determined with an \gls{agm} described in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:Mag_char}. Due to the composition of the Truform material with high percentages of iron and chromium (see Table\,\ref{table:mat_material}) ferromagnetic behaviour with a low remanence was expected. The resulting magnetization curve for the TruForm material (Figure\,\ref{fig:Prax_hyst}) exhibits, as expected, ferromagnetic behaviour, which can be seen by the displayed hysteresis loop. From this hysteresis loop the magnetic properties (e.g. the coercivity $H_{c}$, ..) of the material can be extracted (see Section \ref{subsec:Mag_mat}). The suitability of a material for magnetic separation can be determined by its coercivity $H_{c}$. Magnetically soft materials with a value of $H_{c}$ below 1\,kA/m are desirable as matrix materials, as they are easily magnetized and more importantly retain almost no remanent magnetization once the magnetic field is removed. This behaviour enables a simple removal of collected nanoparticles from the column after a retention experiment. However, the TruForm particles with a $H_{c}$ value of 3.55\,kA/m do retain a remanence magnetization. Therefore the column packed with the TruForm matrix material was demagnetized to remove all collected nanoparticles after each experimental cycle and to restore the initial conditions. \FloatBarrier

The particle size and shape of the \gls{pmma} matrix material, which was used as a negative control because of its non-magnetic behaviour, was determined under the light microscope. The diameter of the spherical particles was measured with the distance measurement function of the light microscope as described in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:light_mic}. An exemplary microscope image of the \gls{pmma} particles with diameter measurements is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:PMMA}. It can be clearly seen that the particles are almost perfectly spherical and of a uniform size of approximately 17\,\textmu m, which matches the manufacturers specifications. The uniform spheres, with a variation of less than 5\,\% around the average size of 17\,\textmu m, form a closely stacked lattice within the column, that results in uniform channels for homogeneous fluid flow.

The particle size distributions of the magnetic nanoparticle suspensions were measured via dynamic light scattering. In order to evaluate the nanoparticles the D-values were determined by a fit of the cumulative distribution Q$_{3}$.

It was already demonstrated by \cite{AndreMaster}, that the Chemagen nanoparticles form aggregates. Therefore the nanoparticles were filtered through a filter with a pore size of 450\,nm before each experiment to remove the largest aggregates from the particle suspension, which should minimize a size exclusion effect within the column. In Figure\,\ref{fig:hist_chemagen} it can be clearly seen that no particles larger than the filter pore size were detected in the filtered solution. With a volumetric D50 value of 101.06\,nm the Chemagen nanoparticles are still considerably larger than the average particle size of 10\,nm to 20\,nm in magnetic nanoparticle suspensions mentioned by \cite{svoboda2004magnetic}. In addition a wide particle size distribution from approximately 50\,nm to 400\,nm is apparent. This can also be attributed to the agglomeration of the particles with an individual size between 20\,nm and 50\,nm.
In order to get a more precise evaluation of the separation efficiency of the tested column, nanoparticles with a more narrower particle size distribution from Micromod were examined. The results of the particle size measurements of the Micromod particles for two different particle sizes, 20\,nm and 100\,nm, as well as a 1:1 mixture of the two suspensions are also depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:Hist_nano}. It can be seen that all three solutions exhibit far narrower particle size distributions in a range between approximately 20\,nm to 300\,nm. The measured volumetric D50 value of 99.96\,nm fits very well with the manufacturers data of an average particle size of 100\,nm. For the 20\,nm particles, however, the determined D-value of 40.67\,nm is much larger than the indicated 20\,nm range. The variation result from the volumetric approach of the particle measurement in which larger particles have a stronger influence on the D-values than in an number based approach. For the 20\,nm Micromod particles a bimodal distribution is observed. The first mode exhibits a mean particle size of approximately 20\,nm, while the second mode is comparable to the size distribution of the 100\,nm particles. Aggregation of the nanoparticles is unlikely as the unmodified dextran surface is negatively charged, which leads to mutual repulsion of the particles. In addition, 20\,nm is close to the sensitivity limit of most measurement systems and it is very difficult to produce uniform particles in that size range. According to the manufacturer specifications, a deviation of the particle size of up to 100\,nm can be possible for the 20\,nm particles. The mixture of the two particle sizes, which was used for separation experiments, also results in a bimodal size distribution which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:hist_micro_20}. A first mode with the peak at approximately 20\,nm and a second mode at around 50\,nm can be observed. Despite the deviations of the particle  size, the Micromod particles exhibit a much smaller particle size distribution than the Chemagen nanoparticles, which makes them more suitable for initial separation experiments. According to manufacturers specifications the size of the magnetite domains within the Micromod particles lies between 5 and 15\,nm. As this is a much smaller domain size than the critical size for magnetite of 0.05\,\textmu m, the Micromod nanoparticles are superparamagnetic. In \cite{AndreMaster} it was also shown that the Chemagen nanoparticles exhibit superparamagnetic behaviour.

\subsection{Flow rate optimization}
\label{subsec:flow_rate_res}

The two matrix materials \gls{pmma} and TruForm were selected for the retention experiments based on their magnetic properties, shape and particle size distribution (see previous section). In a next step the optimal flow rate for the packed column in a \gls{fplc}-system was determined. Three different flow rates, 0.1\,ml/min, 0.2\,ml/min and 0.5\,ml/min, were tested for the two materials with the Chemagen nanoparticles diluted in 20\,mM phosphate buffer wit a pH of 6.5. Higher flow rates were not considered due to the high pressure build-up and the pressure limit of the glass column and filters at 80\,bar. Exemplary curves, resulting form the different flow rates for the TruForm matrix material, are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:flowrate_prax}. The conductivity peak is caused by the 20\,mM phosphate buffer, which is used as tracer as it is not influenced by either the matrix material or the magnetic field and therefore always has a similar shape, area and peak maximum. All three UV-peaks exhibit a baseline width of about 1.85\,ml with a peak maximum at approximately 0.6\,ml. The peak maximum however varies from 230\,mAu for a flow rate of 0.2\,ml/min to 140\,mAu for a flow rate of 0.1\,ml/min. 
For an ideal packed bed the resulting peaks should exhibit a Gaussian profile. Due to inhomogeneities in the packed bed and dead volume in the flow path deviations like fronting and tailing can occur. Tailing can also be observed for all three tested flow rates. As a flow rate of 0.5\,ml/min showed the best results and was already used by \cite{AndreMaster} a flow rate of 0.5\,ml/min was chosen. In addition a high number of screening experiments was only possible with the faster flow rate of 0.5\,ml/min.

}
\end{figure}

In order to quantify the tailing and to evaluate the quality of the packed bed, the asymmetry factor $A_{s}$ was determined as described in Section \ref{sec:peak_as} for the column with an acetone peak injection. A value of $A_{s}$ smaller than 1 indicates fronting, while a value of $A_{s}$ larger than 1 indicates tailing as described in Section\,\ref{sec:peak_as}. For a packing with \gls{pmma} an asymmetry between 1 and 2 and for a packing with the TruForm particles an asymmetry between 1 and 1.5 was considered tolerable. Those values were determined by analyzing multiple acetone peaks for several newly packed columns for each matrix material. For deviating values of $A_{s}$ the column was repacked.

\subsection{Retention experiments with the PMMA matrix material}
\label{subsec:pmma_res}
The characterization of the \gls{pmma} matrix materials size distribution and shape are shown in Section \ref{subsec:mat_mag_char_res}. With a homogeneous size of 17\,\textmu m and an almost spherical shape, the particles are well suited to form a homogeneously packed bed within the column. \gls{pmma} was chosen due to its diamagnetic properties \cite{wapler2014magnetic} as negative control for the retention experiments performed with the ferromagnetic matrix materials in Section\,\ref{subsec:trufrom_res} and by \cite{AndreMaster}. In contrast to ferromagnetic materials, diamagnetic materials are only weakly magnetized once an external magnetic field is applied. Consequently no significant magnetic field gradients should be produced to retain the magnetic nanoparticles within the matrix (for more information see Sections\,\ref{subsec:Mag_mat} and \ref{sec:Mag_sep}). Therefore the \gls{pmma} matrix material was used to test whether an influence of the magnetic field could still be detected even without a ferromagnetic matrix and whether a size exclusion effect is produced by the packed bed in the column. \\
For all experiments in this Section the Chemagen nanoparticle suspension was used. 
As the aggregates in the Chemagen nanoparticle suspension could not be completely removed by an ultrasonic treatment (see Section \ref{subsec:mat_mag_char_res}), it could not be guaranteed that the solution was comprised of the same amount of particles each experimental cycle. Therefore the results of each cycle were normalized by experimental runs with no magnetic field applied, that were conducted at the beginning of each cycle with the same sample solution. In addition to the different magnetic flux densities different frequencies were applied to simulate a constant, changing or on/off setting of the magnetic field (see Section \ref{subsubsec:Ret_nanopart_method}).

        \label{fig:PMMA_peaks_comp}
  \end{figure}
  
Exemplary peaks for a constant magnetic field with $B_{0}$ values of 0 and 13.4\,mT are shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:PMMA_peaks_comp}. Again it can be seen that the conductivity peak produced by the phosphate buffer can be used as tracer, as it is not influenced by either the matrix material or the magnetic field and exhibits for both cases a peak maximum at 0.6\,ml and similar peak shapes. It can be seen that the triplicate runs for both magnetic field strengths show an almost identical peak shape. This similarity was also observed for all other triple determinations performed with the \gls{pmma} column and indicates a high reproducibility of the results. Comparing the nanoparticle peaks at 0\,mT with the peaks at 13.4\,mT no retention or peak broadening can be detected. In addition the peak maxima for both peaks are located at 0.5\,ml.

\label{fig:norm_area_PMMA}
}
\end{figure}

In order to quantify the deviation of the peak area from the control peaks at 0\,mT the normalized area and retention were calculated (see Section\,\ref{subsubsec:Math_eval}). The normalized retention plotted against the applied magnetic field is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:norm_area_PMMA}. All runs were performed with a high level of 400\,mV, while the different low-level values indicate the different magnetic field configurations, e.g. 396\,mV for a constant magnetic field, 0\,mV for a field that is turned on and off and -400\,mV for a magnetic field that is reversed with the indicated frequency. Almost no deviation from the control peak at 0\,mT can be observed. The slight deviations of less than 0.1 most noticeable at 6.8\,mT are most likely due to slight differences in the nanoparticle composition of the injection samples or the collection in the column filters. Neither the different frequencies nor the different magnetic field settings exhibit an influence on the peak area. It is clear that the magnetic field does not influence the size of the peak area, therefore it can be concluded that no magnetic nanoparticles are retained or collected within the column through magnetic field gradients. This is supported by the curves depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:norm_ret_PMMA}, where the normalized retention divided by the normalized area is plotted against $B_{0}$. The retention is divided by the area in order to gain the retention values independently from possible peak area losses. Again no differences between the runs for different magnetic fields and different field settings can be observed. The results from the different runs are not distinguishable from each other by neither their retention nor their area. Also no size exclusion effect, that would result in peak broadening, can be observed.

\label{fig:norm_ret_PMMA}
}
\end{figure}

In this section it was demonstrated that no retention of peak broadening could be achieved for different magnetic fields with the diamagnetic matrix material. This confirms the hypothesis that the size separation and retention effect observed by \cite{AndreMaster} is mainly due to the magnetic field gradients produced by the magnetized ferromagnetic matrix material within the column and not due to size exclusion effects within the packed bed.

\subsection{Retention experiments with the TruForm matrix material}
\label{subsec:trufrom_res}
The main objective of this section was to evaluate the influence of the magnetic field on the matrix material and the nanoparticle suspensions. Due to its low remanence, narrow particle size distribution and mostly spherical shape, the ferromagnetic TruForm material was selected as matrix for the retention experiments. The main goal was to reproduce the retention and size separation effect for an externally applied magnetic field already observed by \cite{AndreMaster} with the new matrix material. The results from the retention and separation experiments with the Chemagen nanoparticles are presented and discussed in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:chemagen_res}. In Section\,\ref{subsubsec:micromod_res} separation experiments with Micromod nanoparticles are described.   

\subsubsection{Separation experiments with nanoparticles of the brand Chemagen}
\label{subsubsec:chemagen_res}
The Chemagen nanoparticle suspension with its wide particle size distribution (see Section\,\ref{subsec:mat_mag_char_res}) was used in order to evaluate the size separation effect produced within the packed bed by different magnetic field strengths applied to the column. The same magnetic field settings and frequencies as described in Section\,\ref{subsec:pmma_res} were tested. In addition, experiments with a frequency of 500\,mHz and longer high-level periods (delay of 80\,\%) were tested. Though some retention could be observed for the changing and the on/off magnetic field, no size separation effect could be  detected. Therefore in the following section only the results for constant magnetic fields with a low-level value of 396\,mV are discussed. A complete plot of the retention results including the other magnetic field settings can be found in the Appendix (see Figure\,\ref{fig:??}).
   
In Figure\,\ref{fig:chemagen_const_comp} the results for the three different retention experiment cycles with a constant magnetic field at a frequency of 1\,Hz with a high-level of 400\,mV and a low-level of 396\,mV are shown. The separation efficiency of the column was determined by plotting the normalized area against the magnetic flux density $B_{0}$. A decrease in the normalized peak area indicates a collection of the particles by the matrix material within the column. Only the retention of the nanoparticles within the magnetized packed bed and not the collection of the particles by the matrix material was desired. This could be achieved by choosing a magnetic flux density at which a retention is apparent but no significant decrease in the peak areas can be observed. In Figure\,\ref{subfig:chemagen_const_comp_area} the separation efficiency for the three different experimental cycles is depicted. Both for the first and the third cycle show a continuous decrease in the peak area with increasing values of $B_{0}$. Cycle 2 however exhibits a slight increase of 5\,\% of the peak area at 2.21\,mT followed by a sharp decrease with a minimum peak area of only 70\,\% at 6.03\,mT as compared to the 0\,mT peak, which is followed by an outlier with less than 10\,\% peak loss as compared to the 0\,mT peak area. The resulting normalized area of the third cycle exhibits a similar development as the one already observed by \cite{AndreMaster}. For $B_{0}$ values up to 6.74\,mT no significant decrease (less than 5\,\%) of the peak area can be observed. This indicates, that for those $B_{0}$ values no collection of the particles within the column takes place. In \cite{AndreMaster} over 60\,\% of the nanoparticles were retained at magnetic field strengths of only 4\,mT. Consequently, the TruForm material is more suitable as matrix material for the retention experiments than the formerly used SRA-150 material. However, the curves depicted here do not exhibit a high reproducibility.  Differences in the curve progressions for the different cycles are most likely due to the variations in the Chemagen nanoparticle samples, which were already described in Sections\,\ref{subsec:mat_mag_char_res} and \ref{subsec:pmma_res}. Due to the inhomogeneities of these nanoparticles even the normalized peak areas lead to neither comparable nor reproducible results.

        \label{fig:chemagen_const_comp}
  \end{figure}

In Figure\,\ref{subfig:chemagen_const_comp_ret} the retention is plotted against the magnetic flux density for the three different experimental cycles. In contrast to Figure\,\ref{fig:norm_ret_PMMA}, the retention increases continuously with an increasing magnetic field strength for all three cycles. The nanoparticles are retained within the column due to the induced magnetic field gradients in the ferromagnetic matrix material. The highest retention of 1.13 was reached at 12.8\,mT. This is, however, still much smaller than the retentions observed by \cite{AndreMaster} of 1.2 and above. \cite{nomizu1996magnetic} also reported the retention of nanoparticles by a magnetized packed be in 1996. However no followup investigations in this direction were conducted. In addition no size separation effect was examined. \\
In order to investigate the influence of the nanoparticle concentration on the retention behaviour, the particles were tested with the dilutions of 1:100, 1:150 and 1:200. The corresponding peaks for the different nanoparticle concentrations can be found in Figure\,\ref{fig:diff_conc_chemagen_peaks} in the Appendix. The resulting separation efficiency and the retention of the concentration experiments are shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:chemagen_conc_comp}. Only for the 1/200 dilution a decrease in the peak area over the whole tested range of $B_{0}$ can be observed. For the other two concentrations almost no particles are collected in the column even for high magnetic flux densities. In Figure\,\ref{fig:diff_conc_chemagen_peaks} the peak broadening effect of the magnetic field is apparent. The peak maximum is decreased but the peak area stays almost the same as shown in Figure\,\ref{subfig:chemagen_conc_const_area}. In Figure\,\ref{subfig:chemagen_conc_comp_ret} retention curves are depicted. It can be seen that both at 12.8 and 17.0\,mT the 1:150 diluted particles are more strongly retained than the two other dilutions. A maximum retention of 1.24 is reached at 17.0\,mT for the 1:150 dilution, while the 1:100 and 1:200 dilutions only exhibit retention values of 1.17 and 1.07 respectively.

As the magnetic force $F_{m}$ is dependent on the particle size, a size separation effect within the column was expected. It was already shown by the simulation results in Section\,\ref{subsec:Param_res} that larger particles exhibit a longer residence time than smaller nanoparticles. This effect could also be observed for the retention experiments in which the magnetic field was constant. In Figure\,\ref{fig:chemagen_size_separation} the resulting size distributions for the fractionated peaks of a 1:100 Chemagen nanoparticle suspension for 0 and 12.8\,mT are plotted. For each fraction the D10, D50 and D90 values were determined. For comparison the D-values from the original Chemagen nanoparticle suspension were included. The same general development of the particle sizes can be observed for both magnetic flux densities. The first three fractions are characterized by an increase with a maximum of D50 in the third fraction of 126 and 97\,nm for 0 and 12.8\,mT respectively. In fractions 4 and 5 a slight decrease in the D50 values to 116 and 95\,nm is apparent. The D90 value in the first fraction for 12.8\,mT is with 81\,nm almost 45\,\% lower than the D90 value for 0\,mT. This trend continues with the D90 value in fraction 3 being 35\,\% smaller than the corresponding value at 0\,mT. Compared to the original solution it can be seen, that the size distribution in each fraction does not equal the size distribution of the sample before injection. It can be seen, that larger particles are retained longer within the column and elute at a later time than smaller particles. In addition, a collection of the largest particles within the column can be observed.  This effect was already demonstrated in the simulations in Section\,\ref{subsec:Param_res}.

In this section, the retaining and peak broadening effect of the magnetic field on nanoparticles within a magnetized packed was demonstrated. The results from \cite{AndreMaster} could be reproduced with the TruForm matrix material. In addition, it was found that a nanoparticle dilution of 1:150 produced the highest retention values. Furthermore a size separation effect due to the packed bed and the magnetic field was observed. However, due to the high variability of the used nanoparticle suspension the results where neither completely comparable nor exhibited a high reproducibility. Therefore the Micromod nanoparticle suspensions with a narrower particle size distribution and no aggregation were investigated. The results for the Micromod nanoparticle separation experiments are presented and discussed in the following Section\,\ref{subsubsec:micromod_res}.

\subsubsection{Separation experiments with nanoparticles of the brand Micromod}
\label{subsubsec:micromod_res}
A size separation effect on the Chemagen nanoparticles due to the magnetic field could be observed in the retention experiments discussed in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:chemagen_res}. In order to further investigate this size separation effect, the retention experiments were repeated with Micromod nanoparticles with an average particle size of 20 and 100\,nm. In addition a 1:1 mixture regarding volume of the 20 and 100\,nm particle suspension was tested to examine whether a size separation of the two components was possible.

First, retention experiments were conducted for different magnetic flux densities at constant magnetic field settings with the individual particle suspensions. The resulting peaks for the 100 and 20\,nm nanoparticle suspension are shown in Figures\,\ref{subfig:micromod_100nm_peak} and \ref{subfig:micromod_20nm_peak} respectively. The curves for the different magnetic flux densities for the 100\,nm particles all exhibit a similar progression. A shoulder at 0.43\,ml is followed by the main peak with a maximum at 0.55\,ml. The same can be observed for the 20\,nm particles, where the main peak has a maximum at 0.50\,ml, which is followed by a shoulder between 0.5 and 0.6\,ml. The observed shoulders can be explained by the measured particle size distributions in Section\,\ref{subsec:mat_mag_char_res}, which show a large variation of over 150\,nm between the D10 and D090 values for the 100\,nm particles and even a bimodal distribution for the 20\,nm particles. The nanoparticles are not of an uniform size and travel at slightly different velocities through the column, which produces the observed shoulders. 
It can be seen in both plots, that the peak height is reduced with increasing magnetic field strengths. In addition a peak broadening effect can be observed. The normalized area of the peaks (not shown) with values of 1.006 for the 100\,nm and 1.008 for the 20\,nm particles at 17.0\,mT shows that the decrease in peak height is balanced by the increase in peak width so that the peak area stays the same. Hence, it can be concluded that in contrast to the Chemagen nanoparticle retention experiments no Micromod nanoparticles are collected within the column even at higher magnetic field strengths. This difference can be explained by the much smaller particles of the Micromod nanoparticles due to a lack of aggregation, which are exposed to a lower magnetic force $F_{m}$, as compared to the larger aggregated Chemagen particles. A maximum retention is reached at 17.0\,mT with 1.14 and 1.12 for the 100 and 20\,nm particles, respectively.

The resulting peaks for the 1:1 mixture of the two particle types are shown in Figure \ref{subfig:micromod_mix_peak}. Again a decrease of the peak size and a peak broadening effect with increasing magnetic flux density is apparent. As for the 100 and 20\,nm peaks the two effects balance, which is indicated by the calculated values of the peak area, that vary less than 1\,\% from the control run at 0\,mT. Two peak maxima at 0.39 and 0.52\,ml can be observed. This corresponds roughly to the peak maxima of the 20\,nm particles at 0.40\,ml and of the 100\,nm particles at 0.55\,ml. The higher the applied magnetic flux density, the more distinct and separated the two peaks become. This suggests that a complete separation of the peaks should be possible by either applying even higher magnetic field strengths or by changing other process characteristic like the column length or the particle size of the matrix material.
     
In order to investigate the size separation effect more closely, the above shown peaks were fractionated with a fraction volume of 0.2\,ml after they passed the detectors. The fractions were then analyzed for their particle size distribution.  The resulting D10, D50 and D90 values for each fraction at 0 and 12.8\,mT as well as for the original particle suspensions are depicted in Figure\,\ref{fig:micromod_partPGV_values}. The particle size distribution for the 100\,m particle suspension illustrated in Figures\,\ref{subfig:100nm_0mT} and \ref{subfig:100nm_128mT} shows the same size separation effect of the magnetic field that could already be observed in Figure\,\ref{fig:chemagen_size_separation}. Here the effect appears to be even more pronounced as a continuous increase of the D50 and D90 values from 39 and 59\,nm in the first fraction to 59 and 110\,nm in the fourth fraction can be observed. For the Chemagen nanoparticles this increasing tendency could only be observed for the first three fractions. For the D10 values however no clear tendency can be detected. The fractions at 0\,mT do exhibit a size separation effect. All fractions of both the 0 and 12.8\,mT runs however show a narrower particle size distribution width a maximum difference of 90 and 89 between the D10 and D90 than the original nanoparticle suspension with a difference of 158\,nm.

The size distributions for the fractions for the 20\,nm particles for magnetic flux densities of 0 and 12.8\,mT are illustrated in Figures\,\ref{subfig:20nm_0mT} and \ref{subfig:20nm_128mT}. An increase of the D90 values from 62\,nm to 79\,nm within the first three fractions can be observed even at 0\,mT. This might be due to a slight size exclusion effect generated by the matrix material or to a slight remanence magnetization that was no completely removed by the degaussing coil. At 12.8\,mT  also only an increase of the D90 value by less than 15\,\% between the second and the fourth fraction can be detected. The first fraction with a D10 value of 25\,nm, a D50 value of 40\,nm and a D90 value of 101\,nm exhibits a much wider particle size distribution with larger D90 values than either fraction two to four or the original particle suspension. The detection of larger particles at the beginning of the elution stands in contrast to the size separation effect observed for the 100\,nm particles, where the smallest particles eluted earliest. This might be caused by the 20\,nm particles, being close to the sensitivity limit of the measurement system, not being detected properly. In addition the used 20\,nm particles were much larger with deviations of up to 100\,nm as compared to the manufacturers specifications, which also complicated a separation. This problem could be adressed by using two nanoparticle suspensions with more narrow particle size distributions that do not overlap.

In this section the size separation effect observed in Section\,\ref{subsubsec:chemagen_res} was further investigated. This effect could be clearly demonstrated for the 100\,nm Micromod nanoparticles. For the 20\,nm particles only a very slight size separation could be observed. In addition, a mixture of the the two particle suspensions was used (see Figure\,\ref{subfig:micromod_mix_peak}), to test the suitability of the column to separate the two components. However, due to the polydispersity of the particle suspensions a size separation of the components could not be proven.
